Jennifer showed up at my apartment door with takeout and a gift bag, which meant either (a) she had exciting news, (b) she needed something, or (c) both. With Jennifer it's usually both.

"I brought you something!" She set the bag down on my coffee table—the one Dad helped me move in, the one that still has paint splatters from our shop renovation project—and pulled out a leather-bound journal.

Beautiful. Expensive-looking. The kind of thing I'd never buy myself because practical people buy notebooks from the dollar store, not journals that cost more than a day's worth of coffee beans.

"It's a gratitude journal," she said, settling into my oversized chair (the one Mom sent, the one that still makes me tear up when I think about it). "You write three things you're grateful for every day. It'll change your life."

I stared at the journal. It stared back at me, all leather-bound and judgmental.

"Jennifer, I don't—"

"I know you're going to say you don't have time or you're not good at this stuff, but trust me. Three things. Every day. That's it. It rewires your brain to look for the good instead of scanning for disaster."

She said "scanning for disaster" like she'd been reading my mind. Which was rude. Accurate, but rude.

"Studies show that practicing gratitude reduces anxiety by up to forty percent," she continued, because Jennifer never makes a statement without backing it up with a statistic she may or may not have fully understood.¹ "It changes your neural pathways. Literally. Your brain starts looking for things to be grateful for automatically."

"Automatically," I repeated.

"Automatically!"

I took the journal. Opened it. The pages were cream-colored, thick, the kind that wouldn't bleed through if you used a fountain pen (not that I own a fountain pen, but the pages knew their worth). Inside the front cover, Jennifer had written: *For Rena LeeAnn—who is learning to see the good. Love you. —J*

And just like that, I was crying into my Chinese takeout.

This is my life now.

Day one was easy. Almost embarrassingly easy.

I sat cross-legged on my bed—wearing jeans at 10 PM because I could, because nobody was going to tell me what to wear in my own apartment—and wrote:

1. *Coffee. Always coffee. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Riverside Roasting, which arrived today and smells like jasmine and hope.*

2. *Freedom. The kind that looks like denim and tastes like not asking permission.*

3. *Jennifer. Who shows up. Who sees me. Who gave me a journal I'll probably cry in.*

I closed the journal feeling accomplished. Proud, even. Look at me, being grateful. Rewiring my neural pathways. Forty percent less anxious already.

Day two: Still easy. I wrote about Betsy not leaking, about a customer who complimented my pour-over technique, about the way afternoon light comes through the shop windows and makes everything look like it's being filmed for an indie movie about coffee and redemption.

Day three: Grateful for... um...

I sat there for twenty minutes. Staring at the blank page. Surely there were three things. There had to be three things. I'd been alive for approximately 29 years and change, running a coffee shop for several months, living independently for—how long had it been? Long enough that I should be able to list three good things without my brain short-circuiting.

I wrote: *The shop didn't burn down today.*

Then I sat there, pen hovering, wondering if that counted as gratitude or just baseline relief that I hadn't committed accidental arson.

Eventually I added: *No major disasters* and *Jennifer didn't ask how the journal was going*.

I closed it feeling like I'd just failed a test I didn't know I was taking.

By day seven, I was furious.

Not at Jennifer. Not even at the journal, really, though it sat on my nightstand looking smug and leather-bound. Furious at myself. At my brain. At whatever broken thing inside me couldn't just BE GRATEFUL like a normal person.

I opened the journal. Stared at the page.

*Romans 8:1,* I thought, which is what I think when guilt starts creeping in like a fog. *"There is therefore now no condemnation."*

But I felt condemned anyway. Condemned by my own inability to see good things. Condemned by the blank page and my blank mind and the growing certainty that I was failing at something that should be simple.

I wrote, pen pressing too hard into the page: *I'm grateful I didn't burn down the shop today. Again. Still. Whatever.*

Then: *I'm grateful Betsy is still working even though I don't deserve her.*

And finally, after a long pause: *I'm grateful that tomorrow I can try this again and maybe not suck at it.*

I threw the journal across the room. It hit the wall (didn't damage it, because even in my rage I couldn't bring myself to hurt the journal Jennifer had bought me) and landed open on the floor, pages spread like a bird with broken wings.

I left it there. Went to bed. Woke up at 3 AM scanning for disasters, just like Jennifer said.

Some habits don't rewire in a week.

Day fourteen, I called Jennifer crying.

"I can't do it," I said, sitting on my apartment floor in my pajamas, journal open in front of me, pen in hand but nothing on the page. "I can't even be grateful right. I'm failing at gratitude, Jennifer. Who fails at GRATITUDE?"

"Oh babe." Her voice was soft. Not pitying. Understanding. Which somehow made me cry harder. "Tell me what's happening."

"I just—I sit here and I know I'm supposed to find three things, three good things, and my brain just... doesn't. It goes straight to the bad stuff. The things that could go wrong. The ways I'm messing up. I try to think of good things and all I can see is that I knocked over the milk pitcher twice today and I'm probably going to run out of money by March and what if I'm kidding myself about all of this, what if I'm just—"

"Rena."

I stopped. Breathed. There were coffee grounds on my sock. I don't even know how.

"You're learning," Jennifer said. "That's day one, babe. You're just learning."

"Day one was two weeks ago."

"Day one is every day you show up to the practice. Every single day you open that journal? That's day one. That's you choosing."²

I wiped my eyes. Looked at the blank page.

"What if I never get good at this?"

"Then you get good at showing up anyway. That's the whole thing." She paused. "Want me to come over? I can bring ice cream."

"No." I smiled despite myself. "I'm okay. I just needed to hear that I wasn't completely broken."

"You're not broken. You're just rewiring. It takes time."

After we hung up, I sat there for a long moment. Then I picked up my pen and wrote:

1. *Grateful for Jennifer, who answers the phone when I call crying at 9 PM*

2. *Grateful that crying doesn't mean giving up*

3. *Grateful I'm the kind of person who keeps trying even when it's hard*

It wasn't much. But it was true.

Week three, something shifted.

I didn't notice it happening. It was subtle, gradual, the way daylight changes in the morning—you don't see it moving, but suddenly the room is brighter.

I was making an Americano for a regular (Ethan Wilson, works at the bank, always orders the same thing) when he said, "You seem lighter today."

I almost dropped the portafilter. "What?"

"I don't know. You just seem... lighter. Less worried, maybe?"

I stood there, espresso dripping into the cup, and realized he was right. I felt lighter. Not completely unburdened—the anxiety was still there, hovering like background noise—but something had loosened.

That night, I wrote:

1. *Grateful for Ethan Wilson noticing I'm lighter (even though I didn't notice myself)*

2. *Grateful Betsy didn't leak during morning rush*

3. *Grateful I chose joy today even though it was hard. Even though I had to choose it again at 2 PM and again at 4 PM and again at closing. Still counts.*

I read it back and thought: *Huh. That's actually good. That's actually... gratitude.*

The next day, I found myself noticing things. Small things. The way steam curls from fresh espresso. The sound of the door chime when a customer arrives. The fact that Jennifer texted me a meme about coffee and chaos and I laughed out loud in my empty apartment.

I wrote them down. Not because I had to. Because I wanted to remember.

*I'm rewiring,* I thought. *This is what it feels like.*

It felt like freedom.

Messy, imperfect, one-day-at-a-time freedom.

Day 29, I almost forgot.

I'd had a long day at the shop—busy, which is good, but the kind of busy that leaves you wrung out like an old dishcloth. I came home, made myself grilled cheese (because sometimes dinner is just melted cheese on bread and that's fine), and collapsed on my bed.

It was 11:58 PM when I remembered the journal.

I groaned. Sat up. Grabbed it from the nightstand.

Two minutes until the day officially ended. Two minutes to find three things to be grateful for when all I wanted was to sleep and forget that my feet hurt and I'd spilled cold brew on my favorite jeans and I still hadn't figured out how to do inventory without wanting to cry.

I opened the journal. Stared at the blank page.

*Come on,* I thought. *Three things. Just three.*

Nothing came.

I looked at the ceiling. At the old tin tiles that came with the apartment, the ones that probably have stories I'll never know. The ones that have been here longer than me, longer than my problems, longer than my anxiety about whether I'm doing gratitude right.

I looked back at the page.

And I wrote:

*Grateful that I'm the kind of person who comes back to this even when I don't feel like it.*

I paused. Pen hovering.

*Grateful I'm trying.*

One more. I needed one more. It was 11:59 now. Technically I could just write tomorrow's entry and backdate this one, but that felt like cheating and I've had enough of living by rules I'm not sure matter.

*Grateful that showing up is enough. That trying is enough. That I'm enough.*

I closed the journal.

That was it. That was all I had. No profound gratitude about coffee or freedom or friendship. Just the simple, stubborn fact that I'd shown up to the practice again. That I'd chosen to open the journal at 11:58 PM when every part of me wanted to just let it go for one night.

But here's what I'm learning: gratitude isn't always about the big things.

Sometimes it's about the showing up.

The trying.

The choosing to come back even when you're tired and your feet hurt and you don't have anything profound to say.

Sometimes gratitude looks like a leather-bound journal with 29 days of entries, some brilliant and some barely coherent, all of them proof that you're rewiring one day at a time.

Sometimes gratitude looks like knowing that tomorrow is day 30, and you'll show up for that one too.

Jennifer was right.³

It is changing my life.

Just not in the Instagram-worthy, forty-percent-less-anxious, neural-pathway-rewiring way I expected.

It's changing me in the quiet, stubborn, showing-up-anyway way.

The way that lasts.

¹ Jennifer reads a lot of self-help articles and has a tendency to cite studies that may or may not exist. I love her anyway.

² This might be the wisest thing Jennifer has ever said to me. I didn't tell her that. She'd never let me forget it.

³ I will never, ever tell her this. She'd put it on a t-shirt.
