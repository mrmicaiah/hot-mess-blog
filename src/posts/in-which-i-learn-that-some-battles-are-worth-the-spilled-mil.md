Dad texted at 10:47 AM.

Just two words: "Can I visit?"

I stared at my phone for approximately seven minutes[^1] and then did what any rational almost-thirty-year-old woman does when her father asks to see her apartment for the first time: I panicked.

Not regular panic. Industrial-strength, Olympic-level, where-do-I-even-start panic.

Because here's the thing—Dad hadn't seen the apartment since that first day. The day he helped me move furniture. The day he gave me that look when he saw me in jeans. That look that said more than any words could, the look that made something crack in my chest because even my safe parent wasn't completely safe.

Since then: texts. Photos of biscuits. "How's the shop?" messages. But no visits. Ten months of carefully maintained distance that felt safer than closeness.

And now: "Can I visit?"

I looked around my apartment. MY apartment. The space I'd finally made mine.

The oversized cozy chair Mom sent (the one place I felt completely myself). The coffee table covered in theology books—the kind that asked questions instead of just giving answers, the kind that treated Scripture like it could withstand scrutiny instead of requiring blind obedience. The throw pillows Jennifer helped me pick out (teal, because I could have a favorite color now). The mug on my counter—white ceramic with bold black letters that said "Nevertheless She Persisted" (impulse purchase at a bookstore, no regrets, wore it like a badge).

And my jeans. Folded on the chair. The jeans I'd worn yesterday and would wear again today because they were comfortable and practical and I COULD.

The apartment looked like me.

The real me.

The question was: did I have the courage to let Dad see that?

I spent six hours cleaning.

Not normal cleaning. Frantic, erasing-evidence-of-my-actual-life cleaning.

The theology books went under the bed. The "Nevertheless She Persisted" mug went in the back of the cabinet (because those three words—Nevertheless. She. Persisted.—felt like a declaration of war against everything I'd been taught about submission and silence and staying small). I pulled out the one skirt I'd kept (just in case, I'd told myself, just in case I needed to go home, just in case I needed to disappear back into who I used to be) and laid it on the bed.

I could change before he got here. Put the skirt on. Hide the books. Be the daughter he expected. Make it easier for everyone.

I stood there in my jeans and oversized sweater, staring at that skirt, and something in me just—

Stopped.

I'd spent almost thirty years performing. Trying to be small enough, quiet enough, compliant enough to earn love that I'd been told was conditional on my goodness. On my ability to follow rules that Jesus never actually gave.

Romans 8:1: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

Now. Not later. Not once I'd earned it. Not after I proved I was worthy.

Now.

I picked up the skirt. Folded it. Put it back in the closet.

Then I pulled the theology books back out. Put them on the coffee table where they belonged. Got the "Nevertheless She Persisted" mug and filled it with coffee. Left my jeans on.

If Dad was going to see me, he was going to see ME. Not a performance. Not a carefully curated version designed to avoid disappointment.

The real thing. Messy. Questioning. Growing. Free.

If he couldn't handle that—

Well. That would hurt. That would crack something open that I wasn't sure would ever close.

But I couldn't keep hiding. Not anymore.

Not even from the people I loved most.

Dad arrived at exactly 2 PM because Dad is punctual like death and taxes.

I buzzed him up. Listened to his footsteps on the stairs. Opened the door before he could knock (because I'm too anxious to wait for knocking).

"Hi, Dad."

"Rena." He stepped inside. Looked around slowly. Really looked.

I watched him notice everything. The books on the coffee table (titles about grace, about women in Scripture, about faith that asked questions). The teal pillows. The jeans I was wearing. The coffee cup in my hand with its three-word manifesto visible.

The silence stretched. Became physical. I could feel my heartbeat in my throat.

He was going to lecture me. Or worse—he was going to leave. Give me that look again. The one that said *I don't know this person*. The one that made me feel like I'd lost him even though he was standing right there.

I opened my mouth to—what? Apologize? Explain? Defend?

"Do you have any of that Ethiopian coffee?" Dad asked.

I blinked. "What?"

"The coffee. From your shop. The one you're always going on about." He gestured to my mug. "Do you have any here?"

"I—yes. I have some. Do you want—?"

"That's why I came." He sat down in the chair Mom had sent. MY chair. Looked up at me. "Figured if you're going to keep telling me about coffee, I should probably try it the way you make it."

My hands were shaking as I made it. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, the good stuff from Riverside Coffee Roasting, the beans I could talk about for hours if someone let me. I measured carefully (203°F water temperature, 9 bars of pressure, timing the extraction exactly right) and I spilled a little when I poured.

Didn't apologize for it.

Brought him the cup.

He took it. Sipped. Made the face people make when they taste actually good coffee for the first time—surprise, then consideration, then understanding.

"You really did learn something about coffee," he said.

It wasn't *I'm proud of you*.

It wasn't *I approve of your choices*.

It wasn't *I understand why you left*.

But it wasn't silence either.

We talked for three hours.

Not about the big things. Not about church or beliefs or why I'd left or the jeans I was wearing. We talked about coffee. About The Hot Mess and how business was going. About the leak Betsy (my espresso machine) had last month. About Mom's biscuits (she'd sent some in a care package, Dad said, and I cried a little because that meant she was still thinking about me even in her silence[^2]).

He told me about work. About the project he was managing. About the documentary he and Mom had watched about volcanoes (Mom loved volcano documentaries, apparently; I never knew that).

We didn't agree about everything. When he asked if I was attending church anywhere, I told him about Jennifer's Southern Baptist church—the one where women wore jeans and contemporary Christian music played and people talked about God like He was GOOD—and something flickered across his face. Not quite approval. Not quite acceptance.

But not quite rejection either.

Something in between. Something uncertain. Something... trying.

"Your mother worries," he said when he was getting ready to leave.

"I know."

"She doesn't know how to—" He stopped. Started again. "This isn't how we thought things would go."

"I know that too."

He stood in my doorway, looking at me. Really looking. At the jeans. The apartment. The theology books. The woman I was becoming instead of the daughter he'd expected.

"The coffee was good," he said finally. "Really good."

"Thanks, Dad."

"Can I—" He cleared his throat. "Can I come back sometime?"

My chest cracked open. Not breaking. Expanding.

"Yeah," I said. "Yeah, you can come back."

---

After he left, I sat in my cozy chair and cried for probably twenty minutes. Not sad crying. Not scared crying. Something else. Something that felt like grief and hope happening simultaneously.

Because here's what I learned today: you can't build real relationships on performance.

You can't earn love by being small.

You can't create genuine connection by hiding who you actually are.

Sometimes love means risking rejection by showing your true self. Sometimes it means sitting in your apartment in jeans and an oversized sweater and saying *this is me, take it or leave it*. Sometimes it means making really good coffee and hoping that's enough of a bridge when words won't work.

Sometimes it means letting your father see the theology books and the feminist mug and the woman you're becoming and hoping—terrified, desperately hoping—that he'll choose to stay anyway.

He stayed for three hours.

He asked if he could come back.

It wasn't everything. It wasn't resolution or approval or understanding.

But it was something.

It was a beginning.

And for today, that's enough.[^3]

[^1]: Yes, I counted. Anxiety makes you do weird things. Like stare at text messages and calculate exactly how many ways this could go catastrophically wrong.

[^2]: The care package arrived yesterday. Biscuits, homemade jam, and—I kid you not—a set of dish towels with Bible verses on them. I don't know what it means. Is it "I love you"? Is it "I'm praying for your rebellious soul"? Is it both? Champion women communicate in mysterious ways. The biscuits were perfect. I cried while eating them. This is my life now.

[^3]: I made myself more coffee after Dad left. Stood in my kitchen in my jeans. Drank from my "Nevertheless She Persisted" mug. Thought about Romans 8:1 for probably the fifteenth time today. There is therefore NOW no condemnation. Not later. Not eventually. Not after you've earned it. Now. Dad didn't say he was proud. But he asked to come back. That's not nothing. That's not nothing at all.
