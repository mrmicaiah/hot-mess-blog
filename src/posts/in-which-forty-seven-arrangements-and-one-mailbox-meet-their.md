Jamie from Petal & Vine is standing in my doorway at 6:47 AM, and she looks like someone who has recently fought a war and lost.

"Coffee," she says. "Industrial strength. I don't care if it's legal."

I don't ask questions. I just make her a double shot of espresso with an extra shot on top, which is technically a triple shot but I'm calling it a double-plus because "triple" sounds like a cry for help and Jamie already looks like a cry for help personified.[^1]

She takes it. Drinks half of it in one gulp. Closes her eyes.

"How many?" I ask.

"Forty-seven."

"Arrangements?"

"Arrangements. Valentine's orders. Three days to deliver them all and my driver quit yesterday because apparently 'the van smells like death' which is LILIES, Marcus, lilies smell like LILIES—" She stops. Breathes. Drinks the rest of the espresso. "I've been up since 4 AM. I have rose thorns in places I didn't know had places. I'm going to die in a pile of baby's breath and they'll find my body in March."

"That seems dramatic."

"I have forty-seven arrangements, Rena. In three days. In my Civic. In the snow." She stares at me with the hollow eyes of someone who has seen the abyss and the abyss was made of carnations. "I'm not being dramatic. I'm being prophetic."

Here's the thing about me: I have a problem.

The problem is that when someone near me is struggling, I develop an immediate and overwhelming need to fix it, even when I am spectacularly unqualified to fix anything. Jennifer calls this "aggressive helpfulness." My mother called it "not knowing your place." I call it "the reason I'm currently standing in a flower shop at 7 AM volunteering to deliver Valentine's arrangements in my fifteen-year-old sedan that I can barely drive in good weather."

"No," Jamie says.

"Yes," I say.

"You don't even—can you drive in snow?"

"I can drive in snow-adjacent conditions."

"What does that mean?"

"It means I haven't died yet."

Jamie looks at me. I look at Jamie. The arrangements look at both of us, forty-seven silent witnesses to what is about to be either a heroic act of neighborly generosity or a catastrophic mistake.

"Fine," Jamie says, in the voice of someone who has stopped fighting the universe. "But if you crash my flowers, I will haunt you."

"That's fair."

The first three deliveries go fine.

I say "fine" loosely. I mean that I find the correct houses, hand the correct arrangements to the correct people, and only knock over one mailbox, which I maintain was already leaning and therefore not entirely my fault.[^2]

The fourth delivery is where things begin to unravel.

The address says 247 Maple Street. The house I pull up to says 274 Maple Street, but I don't notice this because I'm trying to balance a massive arrangement of roses and lilies while also not falling on the ice that has apparently formed specifically to destroy me. I ring the doorbell. An elderly man answers.

"Delivery from Petal & Vine," I say brightly. "Happy almost Valentine's Day!"

He stares at the arrangement. The arrangement, I now notice, has a card that says "Sorry For Your Loss."

"My wife's not dead," he says.

"That's... good?"

"She's at the grocery store."

"Great! Wonderful! Sorry, I think—" I check the card again. Check the address again. Feel my soul leave my body. "Wrong house. I'm at the wrong house. I'm so sorry. Your wife is alive and I'm leaving now."

I back away. I slip on the ice. I do not drop the flowers, which I consider a victory, but I do land in a snowbank, which I consider a reasonable trade-off.

The elderly man watches me struggle upright. "You need help?" he calls.

"I am HELPING," I shout back, which doesn't make sense as a response but accurately represents my emotional state.

By delivery number twelve, the backseat of my car looks like a flower shop exploded. There are petals everywhere—on the seats, on the floor, somehow in my hair. A single rose has lodged itself in the cup holder like it's trying to escape. The "Sorry For Your Loss" arrangement has been successfully delivered to the correct grieving family, and I only cried a little when the woman hugged me.

By delivery number twenty-three, I've learned that "Maple Street" and "Maple Avenue" are different streets, that GPS lies, and that one very angry dog does not appreciate having flowers left on his porch.

By delivery number thirty-one, I am parked on the side of County Road 7, surrounded by scattered carnations, breathing into my hands because I may have slightly overcorrected to avoid a deer and ended up in a ditch.

The flowers are fine. The car is fine. I am questionably fine.

Jamie pulls up behind me in her Civic, hazards flashing. She gets out. Surveys the scene. Looks at me, covered in rose petals, standing ankle-deep in snow, holding a crushed arrangement of what used to be tulips.

"This is going well," she says.

And I start laughing. I can't help it—the deer, the ditch, the petals in my hair, the elderly man whose wife is very much alive—and then Jamie is laughing too, leaning against her car, and we're both just standing there on the side of the road in the freezing cold, losing it completely.

"I can't do this," Jamie says finally, and she's not laughing anymore.

We're sitting in my car, heat blasting, the remaining arrangements crammed around us like fragrant hostages. She's got her head in her hands.

"The deliveries?" I ask. "Because we've got sixteen left and I think if we—"

"Any of it." She looks up. Her eyes are red. "The shop. The orders. The everything. I took over from my aunt eight months ago and I've been drowning ever since. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to run a business. I smile at customers and then cry in the back room and I haven't asked anyone for help because—"

She stops. Swallows.

"Because asking for help means admitting you can't do it alone," I say quietly.

She nods.

I know this. I know this in my bones—the terror of needing someone, the shame of not being enough, the way we torture ourselves with independence because dependence feels like failure.

"Jamie." I wait until she looks at me. "I just drove my car into a ditch to deliver flowers for you. I have rose thorns in my coat. There's a carnation in my shoe and I don't know how it got there. I am objectively terrible at this."

She almost smiles. "You really are."

"And I'm going to keep helping you anyway. Not because I'm good at it. Because you don't have to do it alone." I pause. "Also because I already knocked over a mailbox in your name and I feel like we're bonded now."

She laughs. It's watery, but it's real.

"Sixteen more," I say. "Together. And then you're coming to my shop and sitting down and drinking actual coffee like a person who deserves rest."

"I don't—"

"That wasn't a question."

We finish the deliveries by 4 PM. Not all of them—we call three customers and reschedule for tomorrow, and Jamie says the words "I'm so sorry, I need more time" into the phone like she's confessing to a crime. But the customers are fine. They're all fine. Nobody dies.

At 4:30, Jamie sits at the counter of The Hot Mess for the first time since I've known her. Eight months of being neighbors, and she's never once sat down in my shop. Always rushing. Always waving through the window. Always too busy to stop.

I make her a cortado—something slow, something meant to be savored—and I set it in front of her.

"You don't have to do everything yourself," I say. "That's not strength. That's just stubbornness wearing a cape."[^3]

She wraps her hands around the cup. Takes a sip. Closes her eyes.

"This is really good," she says.

"I know."

"I mean really good."

"I know."

She opens her eyes. Looks at me. "Thank you. For today. For the disaster of today."

"Thank you for letting me help."

She shakes her head. "I didn't let you. You just... showed up."

"Yeah," I say. "That's kind of what we do here."

Outside, the snow is falling again. The block is quiet. Somewhere in my car, there's still a rose in the cup holder.

I'll deal with it tomorrow. Tonight, I have a neighbor learning how to sit still.

That's enough.

[^1]: To be clear, all coffee served at The Hot Mess is legal. Probably. I haven't actually checked the caffeine regulations, and at this point I'm afraid to ask.

[^2]: The mailbox was definitely already leaning. I maintain this. I will die on this hill.

[^3]: Jennifer said this to me once. I'm recycling it because it's true and also because I'm not above stealing good lines from people who love me.
