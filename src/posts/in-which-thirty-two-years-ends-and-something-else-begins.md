Patricia is wearing lipstick.

This might not sound significant. People wear lipstick all the time. It's a normal human activity that millions of people engage in daily without it being worthy of comment or internal crisis. But Patricia has been coming to The Hot Mess for thirteen months, and in thirteen months I have never once seen color on her lips.

I notice this while making her drink—half-caf, oat milk, extra hot, light foam, the order I could assemble in my sleep now—and I'm so distracted by the lipstick that I almost forget the oat milk, which would have been catastrophic. Patricia does not accept substitutions. Patricia does not accept errors. Patricia accepts her coffee exactly as ordered or Patricia accepts nothing.

Except today Patricia is wearing lipstick, a soft rose color, and when I set her drink on the counter she doesn't immediately inspect the foam ratio.

"Do you have any book recommendations?"

I think I mishear her. "I'm sorry?"

"Books." She gestures vaguely toward the exchange shelf, which is currently dominated by Brenda's romance novel donations. "Something hopeful. Not sappy. Just..." She pauses, and something flickers across her face that I can't quite read. "Hopeful."

Patricia is asking me for a book recommendation. Patricia, who has never once asked my opinion on anything. Patricia, who spent her first six months as a customer telling me everything I was doing wrong.

I remember the first time she walked in.

It was November, maybe three weeks after I opened, and I was still operating on pure terror and caffeine. She ordered a latte, took one sip, and informed me the milk was scorched. She wasn't wrong—I was still learning Betsy's temperament, still figuring out that the steam wand ran hot on the left side. But the way she said it, like I'd personally offended her ancestors, like bad milk foam was a moral failing—

I dreaded her. I vented to Jennifer. "There's this woman," I said, "and she hates everything. The coffee's too hot. The coffee's too cold. The music's too loud. The music's too quiet. I can't win."

"Some people are just like that," Jennifer said, with the confidence of someone who has never doubted her own likability. "Kill her with kindness!"

I tried. I really did. I smiled when Patricia criticized the cup size. I apologized when Patricia said the corner table was wobbling again.[^1] I remade drinks without complaint, adjusted temperatures, learned her order so precisely that I started preparing it the moment she walked through the door.

And still, every visit felt like a performance review I was failing.

Then came the day she sat at the corner table and didn't touch her coffee.

I noticed because Patricia always touches her coffee. She wraps both hands around it, tests the temperature, adjusts her grip, takes a measured sip. It's a ritual. But that day, she just stared out the window at the cemetery, and her coffee went cold, and when I finally worked up the courage to approach—

She was crying.

Not dramatically. Patricia would never do anything dramatically. Just tears, sliding down her face, while she sat perfectly still and looked at the headstones.

"I'm sorry," I said, because I didn't know what else to say. "Can I get you anything? A fresh cup? Some water?"

"My husband left." Her voice was flat. "Thirty-two years. He said he hasn't been happy for the last ten." She finally looked at me, and her eyes were red but her face was composed, controlled, like she was holding herself together through sheer force of will. "I didn't know. How do you not know something like that for ten years?"

I sat down across from her. I didn't ask permission. I just sat.

"I don't know," I said.

We stayed like that for maybe twenty minutes. I didn't try to fix it. Didn't offer advice or platitudes or casseroles. Just sat with her in the rubble of everything she thought she knew, while her coffee went cold and the cemetery watched through the window.

When she left, she paused at the door.

"The foam was good today," she said.

It wasn't a thank you. But it was something.

After that, I understood. The complaints weren't about the coffee. They were never about the coffee. When everything in your life is spiraling out of your control—when your husband is unhappy and you don't know it, when the foundation you built your whole life on turns out to be sand—you control what you can. The temperature of your latte. The stability of your table. The small things that still respond to your corrections.

Patricia wasn't difficult. Patricia was drowning.

The divorce finalized eight months ago. I know because she told me, in her Patricia way—"The paperwork is done"—and then ordered her usual and sat at her usual table and read her usual book. She never mentioned him again. She just kept coming. Tuesdays and Fridays, corner table, complicated order, the routine that held her together when nothing else would.

But slowly, quietly, things shifted.

She started saying "thank you" when I brought her drink. Started nodding at other regulars instead of ignoring them. Started leaving the corner table occasionally to browse the book exchange, though she never took anything. Just looked. Like she was considering the possibility of something new.

And now: lipstick. A book recommendation request. Something hopeful.

I realize I've been standing frozen behind the counter for an awkward amount of time.

"Sorry," I say, already moving toward the shelf. "Yes. Books. I can definitely—let me think—"

I scan the options. The romance novels are probably too much too fast. The self-help section is depressing—someone donated a whole stack about surviving betrayal, which feels pointed.[^2] But there, wedged between a thriller and a cookbook, is a small paperback I remember reading last month. A story about a woman starting over in a small town. Finding unexpected friendships. Learning that the worst thing that happened to her wasn't the last thing that would happen to her.

Hopeful. Not sappy. Just true.

I pull it from the shelf and hand it to Patricia. "This one. It's quiet, but it's... it's good. I think you might like it."

She looks at the cover. Looks at me. For a moment, I see her weighing something—the cost of trust, the risk of trying, the courage it takes to let someone recommend you something when you've spent your whole life insisting you didn't need anyone's input.

"I'll try it," she says.

Three words. A mountain moved.

She takes her coffee and her book to the corner table, and I watch her settle in, and I think about courage. "Be strong and courageous," the verse says. I heard it a thousand times growing up, always attached to big things—missionaries and martyrs, people doing dramatic kingdom work. But no one mentioned that sometimes courage looks like lipstick on a Tuesday. Sometimes it's asking for a book recommendation when vulnerability feels like a foreign language. Sometimes it's just showing up again, day after day, to the place where someone once saw you fall apart.

Patricia is braver than I ever gave her credit for.

I wipe down the counter, knock over the tip jar, and spend the next three minutes fishing quarters out from under the espresso machine. Some things don't change.

But some things do.

[^1]: The table *does* wobble. I've put approximately fourteen napkins under that leg. The problem is architectural. I'm not a miracle worker.

[^2]: I have concerns about whoever donated those books. I hope they're okay. I also hope they found a good therapist.
