Jennifer arrives at 7:03 AM with a clipboard.

This is never a good sign.

"Today," she announces, letting the door bang shut behind her, "is your day off."

"I don't have days off," I say, because I don't. The Hot Mess is open six days a week and on the seventh day I do inventory and cry gently into spreadsheets.

"You do now." She waves the clipboard at me. It has a list. The list has bullet points. The bullet points have sub-bullets. "I've planned everything. You close at 2, we go to Milly's for a late lunch, then we do something fun."

"Something fun is very vague."

"It's intentionally vague. For mystery." She beams at me. "You're going to love it."

I do not think I'm going to love it.

But Jennifer is already behind the counter, tying on an apron that appeared from somewhere—did she bring her own apron?—and I'm standing there holding my coffee like a woman who has lost control of her own shop.

"Jennifer," I start.

"Nope." She holds up a hand. "No arguing. You work too hard. I'm helping. This is me helping."

Here's the thing about Jennifer: she's my best friend.[^1]

She's the person who invited me to church seventeen times before I said yes. She's the person who showed up with pizza and paint when I was alone and terrified in an empty shop. She's the person who believes in me more than I believe in myself, which is beautiful and also occasionally suffocating.

Jennifer helps. It's her love language. It's how she says "I care about you" when words feel insufficient. And usually, I love it.

Today is not usually.

Today I woke up at 4 AM with anxiety about the quarterly taxes. Today the milk delivery was late again. Today I have a headache that started somewhere behind my left eye and has colonized most of my skull. Today I want to stand behind my counter, make coffee, and not talk to anyone about anything.

But Jennifer is here. With a clipboard. And a plan.

"I was thinking," she says, already reorganizing the pastry display, "these would look better grouped by color? Like, all the chocolate things together, and then the lemon things—"

"They're grouped by type," I say. "Scones, muffins, croissants."

"Right, but visually—"

"Jennifer."

She looks up. Smiles. "Trust me. This is going to be great."

---

By 10 AM, she has:

1. Reorganized the pastry display (by color)
2. Changed the music from piano hymns to something she calls "upbeat coffeehouse vibes" that sounds like a guitar being gently assaulted
3. Moved the book exchange shelf six inches to the left "for better flow"
4. Told four separate customers that I "work too hard" and "need more fun in my life"

I am going to scream.

I don't scream. I make pour-overs. I smile at customers. I answer questions about the Guatemalan roast. I watch Jennifer flutter around my shop like a very well-meaning tornado, and I say nothing, because saying something would mean conflict, and I don't do conflict.

I was raised to be agreeable. To say yes. To accommodate. To make other people comfortable even when I'm not.

That training doesn't disappear just because you leave the building it happened in.

The breaking point is small.

It's always small—the thing that breaks you. Not the big dramatic moments but the tiny ones, the accumulation of swallowed words finally hitting capacity.

Patricia comes in at 11:15. She orders her usual—half-caf, oat milk, extra hot, light foam—and I'm reaching for the cup when Jennifer intercepts.

"I've got this one!" she says brightly. "Rena, go sit down. Take a break."

"I don't need a break."

"Everyone needs breaks. That's, like, science."

"Jennifer—"

"Go!" She makes shooing motions. "I know how to make coffee. I worked at Starbucks too, remember?"

Patricia is watching us. Her eyebrow is doing the thing it does when she's forming an opinion she's too polite to voice.

"Her order is specific," I say carefully.

"I know! Half-caf, oat milk. I heard." Jennifer is already steaming the milk. Too hot. I can tell from here it's too hot. "See? I've got it."

I'm holding a portafilter I don't remember picking up, grounds spilling onto my shoes because apparently my hands decided to keep working even when my brain stopped.

I watch her make the drink. I watch her hand it to Patricia with a flourish. I watch Patricia take a sip, and I watch Patricia's face do something complicated.

"It's fine," Patricia says, in a voice that means it is absolutely not fine.

And something in me cracks.

"I need you to stop."

We're in the back room. I pulled Jennifer here because I couldn't have this conversation in front of customers, and also because I needed to be near the deep freeze, which is where I go when I'm trying not to fall apart.

Jennifer's face is doing the thing—the hurt thing, the confused thing, the "what did I do wrong" thing that makes me want to apologize and take it all back.

"Stop what?" she asks. "I'm just trying to help—"

"I know." I press my palms against my eyes. "I know you're trying to help. That's the problem."

"Helping is a problem?"

"Your helping is—" I stop. Breathe. Try again. "When you rearrange my displays without asking. When you change my music. When you tell my customers I work too hard. When you take over Patricia's order even though I said—"

"I was giving you a break!"

"I didn't ask for a break!" My voice is louder than I meant it to be. I see Jennifer flinch. I hate this. I hate all of this. "I didn't ask for a day off. I didn't ask for a plan. I didn't ask for any of this, Jennifer. You just decided."

Silence.

Jennifer's eyes are wet. I feel like a monster.

"I was trying to take care of you," she says quietly.

"I know." My throat is tight. "But taking care of me would be asking what I need. Not deciding for me."

---

We go to Milly's anyway.

Not because the plan demands it, but because we need neutral ground. Somewhere that isn't my shop, isn't her territory, just two women in a booth with coffee that someone else made.[^2]

Milly drops off two mugs without comment. She's good like that—reads the room, doesn't push.

Jennifer wraps her hands around her cup. Doesn't drink.

"I do that a lot, don't I," she says finally. "Decide things."

"Sometimes."

"Mom always said I was bossy." She tries to smile. It doesn't quite land. "I thought I grew out of it."

"You're not bossy." I reach across the table, touch her hand. "You're generous. You're enthusiastic. You show up when people need you, and you don't wait to be asked, and that's—that's a gift, Jennifer. It really is."

"But?"

"But sometimes I need you to hear me when I say no." I pull my hand back. Hold my own coffee. "No isn't me rejecting you. It's me telling you what I need. And what I need isn't always what you think I need."

She's quiet for a long moment.

"I didn't realize it felt like that," she says. "Like I was... overriding you."

"You weren't trying to."

"But I was."

"Yeah." I take a sip. Milly's coffee is fine. Serviceable. Nothing special. "A little."

Jennifer nods slowly. I can see her processing—she's not defensive anymore, just thinking. That's the thing about Jennifer: she doesn't always get it right, but she wants to. She's always trying.

"I'm sorry," she says. "About Patricia's order. And the music. And the—" She waves vaguely. "All of it."

"I'm sorry I snapped."

"You didn't snap. You... firmly corrected." She manages a real smile this time. "That's growth, honestly. The Rena I met three years ago would have just let me steamroll her and cried about it later."

She's not wrong.

"So what now?" she asks.

"Now you let me go back to my shop and put the pastries back in the right order."

"They looked good by color."

"They looked like a rainbow threw up on my display case."

She laughs. It's watery but real. "Fair."

We walk back to the shop together. The afternoon light is gray and soft, snow threatening but not yet falling. Jennifer's shoulder bumps mine.

"Hey," she says.

"Hey."

"I'm glad you told me." She's looking straight ahead, not at me. "Even though it sucked to hear. I'm glad."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Because I'd rather know. Than not know and keep hurting you without realizing."

I feel my shoulders drop. I didn't know they were up.

This is what friendship looks like, I think. Not the absence of friction, but the willingness to feel it. To say the hard thing. To hear the hard thing. To keep walking together anyway.

"You're still my favorite person," I say.

"I better be. I made you three lattes today."

"They were terrible."

"They were experimental."

"They were crimes against coffee."

She laughs again, and I laugh too, and we push through the door of The Hot Mess together. The bell rings. The pastries are still in the wrong order. The music is still aggressively upbeat.

I turn it off. Put the piano hymns back on.

Jennifer watches. Says nothing. Smiles.

It's not perfect. She doesn't fully understand—I can see that. She thinks I'm being particular, maybe a little controlling. And maybe I am. Maybe boundaries look like that from the outside: arbitrary lines that don't make sense to anyone but the person drawing them.

But she's trying. And that's enough for today.

[^1]: This is not hyperbole. I have exactly one best friend. Before Jennifer, I had zero. She's carrying a lot of statistical weight here.

[^2]: Milly's coffee is fine. I'm not being a snob. It's just... fine. This is a compliment. Fine is an achievement. Fine is knowing what you are and not pretending otherwise.
