The envelope is under the door when I lock up Thursday night, and I almost miss it entirely because I'm replaying the cortado I pulled wrong at 4:15—too much microfoam, not enough integration, the kind of mistake a first-week barista makes—and also wondering whether Patricia noticed (she noticed, she definitely noticed, her "it's fine" could strip paint) and my feet are moving toward the back room before my brain registers that I've just stepped on something that crinkles.

Which is how I end up standing in a puddle of yesterday's mop water, holding a plain white envelope with my name written in handwriting that looks like it learned penmanship from a different century.[^1]

Inside: a newspaper clipping, yellowed and soft at the edges, protected by a careful fold. The photo shows a young woman—maybe thirty, dark hair pinned up, wearing an apron—standing in front of a storefront with the kind of smile that doesn't know yet how hard the next forty years will be. The storefront has a different sign, different awning, but I recognize the window immediately.

The corner table window. My window.

On the back, in that same deliberate handwriting: *She lasted 40 years. You will too. —Lou*

Lou's Barber Shop has existed across the street for as long as anyone can remember. Lou himself is somewhere in his sixties, tall and dignified in that quiet way that makes you stand up straighter just being near him. I've waved at him through the window maybe a hundred times since I opened. He's nodded back maybe ninety, which Earl says is actually a high percentage for Lou.

The morning after I find the envelope, I push through his door at 7:45 holding two cups of drip coffee—black, no questions asked—and the bell clunks lower than mine, and the shop smells like Barbicide and aftershave and something woody I can't identify. Lou is sweeping. He looks up when I walk in and doesn't seem surprised at all.

"Wasn't sure you'd come," he says.

"I wasn't sure either." I hold out the coffee. "I brought—I mean, I didn't know what you drink, so I just—it's drip, medium roast, nothing fancy, but if you want something else I can—"

"I see that." He takes the cup. Sips. Doesn't comment, which I'm learning is Lou's version of approval.

I'm still standing there with approximately fourteen questions fighting for position when Lou nods at the barber chair.

"Sit."

"I don't need a haircut."

"Didn't say you did."

So I sit, and the leather is old and cracked and somehow the most comfortable thing I've sat in since Mom's chair arrived at my apartment, and from here I can see my shop perfectly—the corner window, the cemetery behind St. Francis. This is what Lou sees every day. My chaos, from the outside.

"The woman in the picture," I say. "Who was she?"

Lou settles into the other chair. "Miriam Okonkwo. Opened that shop in 1987. Ran it until 2019. Forty years in the building—had a bakery first, pivoted to coffee in ninety-four." Something almost like a smile crosses his face. "Smart woman. Knew when to change."

"What happened in 2019?"

"Retired. Florida. Sends me Christmas cards." He looks out at my shop. "She cried every day, first six months. Did you know that?"

I shake my head.

"Used to see her through the window after closing, sitting at that corner table, crying into her hands. I thought about going over, but—" He shrugs. "Wasn't my place. Didn't know her yet."

"What changed?"

"Pipe burst. Winter of eighty-eight. She came out in just her apron, no coat, and I was the first person she saw." He pauses. "I helped. She let me. After that, we were neighbors."

I think about the pipe burst story Earl tells, how someone ran a coffee operation out of his antique shop for two weeks. The history of this block, layered and deep, and I'm just the latest person trying to add a chapter.

"Why did you give me the clipping?"

Lou looks out at the morning light, at my shop sitting there like it belongs even though most days I'm still not sure I deserve to be there.

"Because you look the way she looked," he finally says. "That first year. Like you're not sure you'll make it."

Something cracks open in my chest.

"I'm not sure I will," I admit. "Some days."

"She wasn't either." He finishes his coffee. "Forty years. You've got time to figure it out."

That night I sit in the chair Mom sent, Mabel claiming my feet, and I think about James—the one in the Bible, not anyone I know—who wrote that if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God. I've been asking for months now, in that fumbling way I pray about everything, and I didn't expect the answer to come through a barber who's been watching my block since before I was born.

But that's how it works, I'm learning. Wisdom shows up sideways.

I write a letter on actual paper because Lou seems like the kind of person who would appreciate the effort.

*Dear Lou,*

*Thank you for the clipping. I've been staring at Miriam's smile all day, trying to figure out how she did it. Then I realized you already told me.*

*She cried. She pivoted. She let people help.*

*I'm not good at that last part yet. But Miriam needed help too, and she made it forty years.*

*The coffee's on me. Any time.*

*—Rena*

I seal the envelope and write *Lou* on the front. Tomorrow I'll slide it under his door before he opens.

Mabel headbutts my hand.

"Forty years," I tell her. "That's a lot of coffee."

She blinks slowly, which I choose to interpret as agreement.

I've got time to figure it out.
