Someone left a book behind.

That's how it started. That's how everything starts, really—with someone leaving something behind and someone else deciding what to do with it.

It was a Thursday afternoon in March, the kind of day where the sun can't decide if it's winter or spring so it just does both at once. I was wiping down tables (and by "wiping down" I mean "moving the crumbs around in increasingly elaborate patterns while thinking about whether I needed to reorder Ethiopian Yirgacheffe) when I found it.

A book. Paperback. Battered. The kind of worn that comes from being loved, not neglected—spine cracked in all the right places, pages dog-eared, margins full of pencil notes in handwriting so small I couldn't read it without my glasses.

*The House on Mango Street.*

I picked it up. Turned it over. No name inside. No phone number. Just someone's notes in the margins and a coffee ring on the back cover that perfectly matched the rings on my tables.

I should have put it in the lost and found box under the counter. That would have been the responsible thing. The organized thing. The thing someone who has their life together would do.

Instead, I put it on the shelf by the window.

The shelf that used to hold nothing but a dying succulent and my collection of coffee-related puns written on index cards that nobody ever read.

I grabbed a sticky note—the pink ones, because apparently I'm the kind of person who color-codes her neuroses now—and wrote: "Free to whoever needs it. - RL"

Then I stuck it on the front cover and went back to making coffee and pretending I understood what I was doing with my life.

---

That was three months ago.

Now there are thirty-seven books on that shelf.

I know because I counted them this morning while having my daily crisis about whether I'm doing enough with my life. Turns out you can spiral about existential purpose AND alphabetize paperbacks at the same time. Multitasking.

It started slowly. A week after I put *Mango Street* out, someone took it. Left behind *The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane*. Then someone took Edward Tulane and left *Where the Crawdads Sing*. Then Crawdads got swapped for *Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine*.

Then someone—I don't know who—made a sign.

An actual sign. Printed. Laminated.

It said: "TAKE ONE, LEAVE ONE. BOOK EXCHANGE. (Please be gentle, these are someone's feelings with pages)"

I found it propped against the shelf one Monday morning when I came downstairs, still half-asleep, wearing the oversized t-shirt I'd slept in and the jeans I'd worn the day before because laundry is a myth and clean clothes are a conspiracy.

I cried a little.

Then I made coffee.

Then I laminated the sign again because the first person had done it wrong and it was already peeling at the corners and if we're going to have FEELINGS WITH PAGES we're going to protect them properly, thank you very much.

The book club wasn't planned.

I need you to understand that. I didn't organize it. I didn't send out invitations. I didn't make a Facebook event or a sign-up sheet or whatever it is that people who have their organizational lives together do.

It just... happened.

Like mold. Or community. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.

It was a Thursday night—eight weeks ago now—and I was closing up. Except I wasn't really closing up because there were still four people sitting at the corner table, and they were *arguing*.

Not fighting. Arguing. The good kind. The kind where everyone's leaning forward and gesturing with their hands and nobody's checking their phone.

I was wiping down the counter (actual wiping this time, not crisis-wiping) when I heard:

"I'm sorry, but you CANNOT tell me that the ending was satisfying. She deserved better—"

"She got what she NEEDED, not what she deserved, that's the whole POINT—"

"The point is that the author is a coward—"

"The point is that life is complicated and messy and sometimes the happy ending is just survival—"

I looked up.

Four people. Four completely different people. All holding coffee cups from my shop. All clutching the same book—*The Midnight Library*.

Nobody had told them to meet. Nobody had organized this. They'd just... found each other. Around my books. In my space.

I stood there with my cleaning rag, watching, and thought: *Oh.*

*Oh no.*

*This is a thing now.*

---

The thing became a THING.

Every Thursday night. 7 PM. No official start time, no official end time, no official anything. People just show up. Grab coffee. Grab a book from the shelf. Sit down. Start talking.

Last week there were nine people.

Nine.

I know all their names now, which is both wonderful and terrifying because I'm terrible with names and excellent at forgetting them at crucial moments.

There's **Charis**—college student, philosophy major, drinks oat milk lattes and has opinions about EVERYTHING. She's maybe twenty, twenty-one, with box-dyed purple hair that's growing out and the kind of contained intensity that makes you think she's either going to change the world or have a breakdown. Possibly both. Probably both. She talks about books the way I talk about coffee—too fast, too passionate, with tangents about Foucault and epistemology that I pretend to follow.

There's **Pam**—retired English teacher, has actually READ everything, drinks black coffee because "that's how coffee should be consumed, Rena, with nothing to hide behind." She's maybe seventy, white hair in a perfect bob, cardigans in every color, and she WILL call you out if you misquote a book. But gently. Like a literary grandmother who loves you enough to correct you. She brings cookies sometimes. Good ones. From scratch.

There's **Lee**—divorced dad, works construction, drinks whatever's cheapest and strongest. He's early forties, tired in a way that goes bone-deep, with paint under his fingernails and calluses on his palms. He reads romance novels. Exclusively. Unapologetically. "My ex-wife said romance was trash," he told me once. "Turns out she was wrong about a lot of things." He cried during the discussion of *Beach Read*. Nobody said anything. Pam handed him a napkin. That was it. That was the whole response. I loved them all so much in that moment.

There's **Jeremiah**—recovering addict, two years clean, drinks decaf because caffeine is apparently a trigger and he's "not risking it for a buzz." He's maybe thirty-five, skinny in a way that speaks to hard years, with nervous hands and a smile that looks like it costs him something. He reads memoirs. Only memoirs. "Fiction feels like lying," he said once. "I've done enough lying." He's reading *Educated* right now. He keeps leaving sticky notes in the margins. I found one that said: "This. This exactly this." I didn't read what part of the page it was marking. Some things are private.

There's **Charlene**—barista from The Daily Grind three blocks down, my accidental competition except we're not competing because she comes here on her days off. She's maybe twenty-eight, Black, gorgeous, with box braids and the kind of effortless style that makes me feel like I'm wearing a potato sack even when I'm in my best jeans. She drinks my coffee and says it's better than hers. I asked why she works at The Daily Grind then. She said, "Rent, baby. Rent." Fair. She reads thrillers. Fast. She finished *The Silent Patient* in two days and REFUSED to spoil it for anyone, even when Charis BEGGED.

And then there are the floaters—people who come sometimes but not always. **Raymond** (tech guy, reads sci-fi, explains the science behind the fiction in detail until Pam tells him to shush). **Jeri** (nurse, reads cozy mysteries, falls asleep mid-discussion because she works night shift). **Ben** (accountant, reads business books, somehow makes them sound interesting).

They're the most mismatched group imaginable.

They should not work.

They work.

I don't run the discussions. I tried once—Week Two, when I thought maybe I should be a LEADER and FACILITATE and do whatever it is that people who start book clubs are supposed to do.

I stood up. Cleared my throat. Said, "So, should we go around and share our favorite—"

"EXCUSE ME," Charis interrupted, "but we need to address the PROBLEMATIC gender dynamics in chapter seven—"

And they were off.

I sat back down. Made myself a coffee. Listened.

They don't need me to run it. They need me to host it.

There's a difference.

Running means controlling. Hosting means creating space.

I can do space. Space I understand. Space is cleaning the tables and keeping the coffee hot and making sure the bathroom doesn't run out of toilet paper and not asking questions when someone shows up crying and just... being here. Being open. Being a place where you can show up with your damage and your dog-eared books and nobody asks you to explain yourself.

Last Thursday, I stayed late cleaning up after they all left.

It was past 10 PM. I should have been exhausted. I kind of was. But also kind of wasn't.

I was collecting abandoned coffee cups—there are always abandoned coffee cups, people get into heated debates about whether *The Song of Achilles* is a romance or a tragedy[^1] and forget they have physical bodies that need to transport cups to trash cans—when I noticed the sticky notes.

They're everywhere now. On books. On the shelf. Little messages left behind:

"Made me cry—pass it on."

"This one saved me."

"Read this when you need hope."

"Trigger warning: parent death. But worth it."

"The ending will wreck you in the best way."

I stood there, holding a stack of cups, reading sticky notes in strangers' handwriting, and I just... stopped.

Stood in the middle of my empty coffee shop. Surrounded by books and notes and the ghost-presence of people who'd just spent three hours arguing about whether *Circe* was better than *The Song of Achilles*.[^2]

This.

This is why I'm here.

Not to make the perfect espresso—though I do, and I will fight you on this.[^3]

Not to have a successful business—though I'm trying, and some months it works.

Not even to prove my mother wrong—though let's be honest, that's still part of it.

But for *this*.

For Thursday nights when mismatched people show up and argue about fiction because it's safer than being honest about their lives. Until gradually—so gradually you almost don't notice—they start being honest about their lives too.

Lee talking about his kids and how hard custody sharing is.

Jeremiah mentioning meetings, just in passing, just acknowledging.

Charis crying about a professor who said she wasn't "serious enough" for grad school.

Pam quietly sharing that her husband died three years ago and she's still figuring out how to be just Pam instead of "Pam and Harold."

Charlene laughing about a disastrous date but also—underneath the laughter—the loneliness of being single at twenty-eight when everyone keeps asking why someone like her isn't married yet.

They're not here for the books. Not really.

They're here for each other. The books are just the excuse. The way in. The safe topic that leads to the unsafe topics. The reason to show up when showing up is hard.

I'm just the person who puts out the coffee and the books and gets out of the way.

I locked up at 10:47 PM. Walked upstairs to my apartment. Made myself chamomile tea because it was too late for coffee even for me.

Sat in my oversized cozy chair—the one Mom sent, which I still can't think about without getting emotional—and opened my journal.

Wrote: *"Community can't be forced, only hosted."*

Then I crossed it out because it sounded too much like something you'd find on an inspirational poster at a corporate office.

Tried again: *"Sometimes the best thing you can do is create space and get out of the way."*

Better. Still not quite right.

Finally: *"I didn't make this. It made itself. I just left the door open."*

That felt true.

I have spent so much of my life trying to DO things. To be ENOUGH. To prove I'm capable and competent and worthy of the space I take up. To show that I'm not just a clumsy disaster who breaks things and forgets where her body is in space.

But maybe the gift isn't what I do.

Maybe it's what I allow.

Maybe it's the shelf I put the book on instead of the trash can.

Maybe it's the note that says "Free to whoever needs it."

Maybe it's keeping the shop open past closing time because people are mid-sentence and I don't want to interrupt.

Maybe it's restocking the toilet paper and the half-and-half and just... being here. Being steady. Being the place where people can bring their damage and their books and find out they're not alone.

I don't know if that's enough. I don't know if *I'm* enough.

But on Thursday nights, when I'm collecting coffee cups and reading sticky notes that say "This one saved me," I think maybe I don't have to be.

Maybe I just have to be here.

Maybe that's the whole thing.

There are thirty-seven books on the shelf now. Thirty-seven books that people loved enough to share. Thirty-seven books with coffee rings and dog-eared pages and margin notes in tiny handwriting.

Thirty-seven invitations to whoever needs them.

And on Thursday nights, at 7 PM, nine people show up to argue about them.

I didn't plan this. I didn't organize this. I didn't make this happen.

I just left a book on a shelf with a sticky note.

And it turns out that's enough.

Sometimes that's more than enough.

Sometimes that's everything.

[^1]: It's both. Obviously. This is not controversial. And yet they argued about it for forty-five minutes.

[^2]: The consensus was "Both. Read both. Stop making us choose." Which is the correct answer.

[^3]: Come at me. I dare you. My espresso is PERFECT even when I'm standing in a puddle and have grounds on my face.
