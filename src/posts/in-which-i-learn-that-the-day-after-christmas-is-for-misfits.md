I opened the shop on December 26th because it was Friday.

That's it. That's the whole reason. The Hot Mess is open Tuesday through Saturday, and December 26th fell on a Friday this year, so I opened. Normal business hours. Nothing heroic about it.

I expected it to be dead.

Friday after Christmas? When everyone's still in their pajamas eating leftover pie and avoiding their relatives? I figured I'd get maybe three customers all day. Maybe Jennifer would stop by out of pity. Maybe Todd would need an excuse to leave his family gathering.[^1]

So at 6:47 AM, I was downstairs flipping chairs off tables and firing up Betsy, my espresso machine, who is arguably my most reliable relationship. The apartment had felt too quiet. My thoughts were too loud. And the only thing that makes sense to me anymore is making coffee.

I didn't expect what actually happened.

---

The first person walked in at 7:23 AM.

Charlotte Thompson. I knew her name because she'd been coming in since October, always ordered an Americano with room for cream, always sat in the corner table by the window. Today she looked like she'd been crying. Or was about to start. Or had stopped just long enough to put on mascara that was now doing that thing mascara does when you've absolutely been crying.

"I wasn't sure you'd actually open today," she said.

"I almost didn't." I was wiping down the espresso bar, which already had coffee grounds on it because coffee grounds are my natural habitat. "But it's Friday, so here we are. Americano?"

"Please." She sat down at her usual table. "My sister asked me yesterday why I'm still single at forty-seven. At the dinner table. In front of everyone. While passing the green bean casserole."

I pulled her shot, poured the hot water, left room for cream. "That's—wow. That's impressively terrible timing."

"She's been workshopping it all year, I think." Charlotte laughed, but it sounded broken. "Saving it for maximum holiday impact."

I brought her the coffee. She cried into it for three minutes while I pretended to organize the pastry case (there were no pastries—I'd given Jennifer the day off).

Daniel Harris arrived at 8:14 AM.

I recognized him from church—Jack Coleman's church, the one that saved me from jean-skirt prison and theological trauma. He usually sat in the back with his wife. Except today he was alone and looked like he hadn't slept in a week.

"Is that coffee fresh?" he asked.

"Made it six minutes ago."

"Perfect." He sat at the counter, which meant I couldn't avoid conversation, which meant I started cleaning things that didn't need cleaning. "My wife left me last Tuesday."

I knocked over the sugar caddy.

"Sorry," he said quickly. "That was—I shouldn't have just said that. You don't even know me."

"No, it's—" I was picking up sugar packets, my hands shaking slightly. "I'm sorry. About your wife. Not about the sugar. Well, also about the sugar, but mainly about your wife."

He laughed. Actually laughed. "It's been the longest week of my life. Yesterday was supposed to be our fifteenth Christmas together. Instead I ate Chinese takeout alone and watched Die Hard because the internet said that counts as a Christmas movie."

"It absolutely does," Charlotte called from her corner. "And anyone who says otherwise is wrong."

And just like that, they were talking. Two strangers who came in alone, now debating the Christmas movie canon while I made Daniel's coffee and tried not to cry about the fact that people can just... talk to each other. Like it's normal. Like they've been doing it their whole lives.[^2]

Ethan Lee showed up at 9:47 AM looking exactly like a college kid who'd survived Christmas on ramen and video games.

"Thank God you're here." He said it with the relief of someone who'd been walking around town looking for signs of life.

"Apparently I am."

"I couldn't afford to fly home this year." He was already pulling out his wallet, which had cartoon stickers on it. "Told my parents I had to work. They believed me because I'm a terrible liar and they wanted to believe me."

"What can I get you?"

"The cheapest coffee you have that won't kill me."

I made him an Americano. Didn't charge him. He cried a little.

Charlotte invited him to sit with her and Daniel. They'd moved to the bigger table. Daniel was telling a story about his wife's mother and Charlotte was laughing and Ethan sat down like he'd been invited to exactly where he belonged.

---

Henry Wilson arrived at 11:02 AM.

I knew Henry. Everyone knew Henry. He'd been married to Eleanor for fifty-three years and she'd died last February and this was his first Christmas without her and I wanted to cry just looking at him standing in my doorway in his cardigan and his grief.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't know where else to go."

"Come in." I was already pulling a shot. "Eleanor always got the cappuccino, right?"

"She did." His voice broke. "I tried to make Christmas dinner yesterday. Her recipes. Burned the ham. Couldn't figure out her notes. Everything was wrong."

Charlotte stood up. Walked over. Hugged him. This stranger—this woman who'd been crying into her Americano ninety minutes ago—just hugged him while he cried into her shoulder and I stood there behind my espresso machine with foam in my hair (don't ask[^3]) and thought: *This is church.*

Not the building.

Not the program.

Not the perfect family gathering with matching sweaters and Instagram-worthy table settings.

This. People showing up broken and finding each other anyway.

By 1:30 PM, someone had ordered pizza.

I don't remember who suggested it. Probably Daniel. But suddenly there were three large pizzas on the big table and everyone was sharing slices and telling stories and Henry was teaching Ethan how to play gin rummy and Charlotte was laughing—actually laughing—and my coffee shop had turned into something I never planned.

A refuge for the emotionally hungover.

"I figured everywhere would be dead today," Ethan said between bites. "The whole town feels like a ghost town. But this? This is perfect."

I was refilling water glasses, which involved me nearly dropping one (classic) and catching it against my hip in a move that would've looked cool if I'd meant to do it. "I honestly expected to spend the day alone reading behind the counter. This is... not that."

"Best decision you've made all year," Charlotte said. "Present company is very grateful."

"Second best," Daniel corrected. "First was naming this place 'The Hot Mess.' Truth in advertising."

Henry smiled. "Eleanor would've loved this place. She always said the best gatherings were the ones that happened by accident."

---

They stayed until 6 PM.

I technically closed at 6 PM on normal days. But this wasn't a normal day and they weren't in a hurry and honestly neither was I. We played cards. Told stories. Charlotte and Henry exchanged numbers—they're meeting next week because she's apparently an excellent bridge player and he needs a partner. Ethan and Daniel are planning to watch Die Hard 2 together this weekend.

They'd all come in alone, carrying yesterday's weight.

They left together, lighter.

I locked the door after they left. Cleaned up pizza boxes and playing cards and coffee cups and thought about what Henry said. *The best gatherings were the ones that happened by accident.*

I didn't plan this.

I just opened the door.

Upstairs in my apartment, I was still wearing my coffee-stained apron and my grandmother's necklace (the one my mom sent with my dad to give to me yesterday) and feeling the good kind of exhausted. The kind where you're tired but you matter. Where you showed up and it counted.

My phone buzzed.

**Todd:** *Thanks for yesterday. Today was hard in a different way.*

I stared at the text for approximately forty-seven seconds before responding.

**Me:** *Same. Good hard though? Does that make sense?*

**Todd:** *Perfect sense. Want company?*

I did. I absolutely did. Which was new and terrifying and something I was learning to say yes to.

**Me:** *Yes.*

He showed up twenty minutes later with Chinese takeout. The good kind, from the place on Morrison Street that actually knows what they're doing. We ate it sitting on my floor because my cozy chair only fits one person and my apartment doesn't have a proper dining table yet.

"How was yesterday?" I asked.

"Well, you were there for most of it." He opened the lo mein container. "Mason asked about you this morning. Wanted to know when you're coming back to teach him to make hot chocolate properly."

I smiled. "Christmas Eve was wonderful. Your family is... they're really wonderful."

"And Christmas Day?"

"Dad came by." I paused, holding an egg roll I wasn't eating yet. "He brought cinnamon rolls from Mom. And terrible coffee that he tried to make the way I make it. Got maybe 40% of it right but he tried."

"That's big."

"Yeah." I took a bite. "We just talked. Normal stuff. Work, church, the Johnsons' dog eating fudge. And then he gave me my grandmother's necklace. Mom sent it through him."

Todd looked at the necklace resting against my collarbone. "That's really big."

"Yeah."

"And today? December 26th misfits?"

"I thought I'd be alone all day. Instead..." I gestured vaguely at everything. "People just kept showing up."

We didn't talk about Christmas after that. We just ate Chinese food and he told me about the espresso machine he's rebuilding for a restaurant downtown and I told him about the December 26th misfits and how they all found each other in my shop and how I still don't totally understand what I'm doing but maybe that's okay.

Maybe showing up matters.

Maybe keeping normal hours on abnormal days is the whole point.

"You did good today," Todd said, right before he left at 9:32 PM.

"I just made coffee."

"You made space." He put on his coat, the one that always smells like coffee oil and possibility. "That's bigger."

After he left, I stood at my window looking down at The Hot Mess, its front lights still on (always the front ones, always), and thought about all the people who'd walked through that door today. Charlotte and her sister's terrible timing. Daniel and his fifteen Christmases. Ethan and his cartoon-sticker wallet. Henry and Eleanor's recipes.

None of them had a perfect Christmas.

Some of them had terrible ones.

But they survived it together, in my shop, over coffee and terrible jokes and pizza that was somehow both too greasy and exactly right.

Because I showed up.

Because I kept the regular hours even when I expected nobody to come.

Romans 8:1: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

Now. Present tense. Even on December 26th. Especially on December 26th.

I'm learning that showing up counts. That being present matters. That sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is just maintain your regular hours and make coffee and let people be broken in your space until they're ready to try being whole again.

The Hot Mess.

Where the coffee is perfect and everyone else is negotiable.

Especially the day after Christmas.

[^1]: He didn't. He showed up at 8 PM with Chinese takeout instead, which was better.

[^2]: This is apparently what people with normal childhoods can do. Just talk. To strangers. Without a twelve-point conversational outline prepared in advance. Wild.

[^3]: I attempted to make a rosetta in a cappuccino while simultaneously reaching for the cinnamon shaker. Physics happened. I am a cautionary tale.
