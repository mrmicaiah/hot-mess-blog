Sterling Ashworth walked into The Hot Mess at 10:37 AM on a Tuesday, and I knew immediately that I was doomed.

Not doomed in the "Betsy's leaking again" way or the "I've knocked over the sugar caddy for the third time today" way. Doomed in the way you know you're about to be judged by someone who has OPINIONS—capital letters, italicized, possibly in a serif font.

He was wearing a wool coat that probably cost more than my first month's rent. His scarf was cashmongst (is that a word? It should be a word—like cashmere but MORE). He had that thing people have when they've been to Italy not for vacation but for "the coffee culture." You can just tell.

"Good morning!" I said, in my best I'm-a-professional-business-owner voice, which is actually just my regular voice but slightly higher pitched because anxiety does that. "What can I get you?"

He looked at my menu board. Then at me. Then at the menu board again.

"What's your best pour-over?"

Oh no.

"Well," I said, and I could feel myself starting to do the THING where I explain too much, "I have a really beautiful Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Riverside Coffee Roasting—they do this amazing light roast that brings out these floral notes, almost jasmine-like? And the terroir of the Gedeo Zone gives it this really bright acidity that—"

"I'll take that," he said. Not unkindly. Just... efficiently.

I nodded. Turned to my pour-over station. Took a breath.

*Okay, Rena. You've got this. You've been studying coffee since you were ten years old. You can make ONE POUR-OVER for ONE INTIMIDATING MAN without completely falling apart.*

Narrator voice: She could not.

Here's the thing about pour-over coffee: it's basically a science experiment that you drink. Water temperature, grind size, bloom time, pour rate, total extraction time—every single variable matters. Get one thing wrong and you've got either sour tea or bitter sludge.[^1]

I measured the beans. Twenty-two grams, exactly. Ground them fresh—medium-fine, like granulated sugar, which is what you want for a Chemex. Rinsed the filter to get rid of the paper taste. Heated the water to exactly 203°F because that's the optimal temperature for this particular roast.

Sterling Ashworth sat at the counter and watched.

I could FEEL him watching.

My hands were shaking a little as I started the bloom—that first pour where you wet all the grounds and let them release carbon dioxide before the main extraction. Thirty seconds. I counted. Out loud. In a whisper. Because apparently I do that now.

First pour. Slow spiral from the center outward. Even saturation. Don't rush it.

Second pour. Same pattern. Keep the water level consistent.

I was sweating. In December. Through my oversized t-shirt, which suddenly felt VERY oversized and VERY unprofessional.

Third pour. Almost done. The coffee was dripping into the Chemex in this beautiful steady stream, and it smelled PERFECT—bright and floral and clean and exactly right.

I did it. I actually did it. Technical perfection. Every measurement exact. Every step precisely timed.

I poured it into one of my mismatched mugs (this one was teal with a chip on the rim but I loved it anyway) and set it in front of Sterling Ashworth with something that was probably supposed to be confidence but came out more like "please don't hurt me."

He lifted the mug. Smelled it. Took a sip.

Set it down.

"Well," he said.

I waited.

"It's correct."

I let out a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. "Oh good! I was—"

"Technically, I mean. The extraction is right. Temperature's good. You clearly know what you're doing."

He took another sip.

"But it's soulless."

I'm not sure what my face did in that moment, but it wasn't good.

"I'm sorry?" I said, which is what you say when you've heard something perfectly but your brain is refusing to process it.

"It's competent," he said, not even looking at me, just studying the coffee like it had personally disappointed him. "Everything's by the book. But there's no heart in it. You made it to prove you could make it. Not because you loved making it." He stood up, left a ten-dollar bill on the counter. "Keep the change."

And then he left.

I stood there for approximately forty-seven seconds, staring at the teal mug with the chipped rim, before I realized I was crying.

Not sobbing. Just tears. Running down my face. Landing in the puddle of water on the counter that I hadn't noticed I was standing in.[^2]

*Soulless.*

Mother's voice in my head: "You'll never be good enough, Rena LeeAnn. Always in la-la land. Always making a mess."

I grabbed a towel and wiped my face, which was stupid because the towel was damp and now I just had wet face. Then I tried to clean up the counter, knocked over the Chemex (empty, thank God), and had to catch it with my elbow in this move that was probably supposed to be athletic but was actually just desperate.

The bell over the door chimed.

"Hi, Rena!" Eugene Manyard's voice. Warm. Familiar. "Am I too early?"

Eugene comes in every Tuesday and Thursday at 11:00 AM. Has for the past three months since I opened. Always orders drip coffee, medium roast. Adds his own cream—just a splash—and drinks it while reading the newspaper he brings from home because "the paper's worth the money but not the coffee at the gas station."

He's maybe seventy-five, maybe eighty. Wears a cardigan regardless of weather. Has kind eyes that crinkle when he smiles, which is always.

"No!" I said, too loud, still crying a little. "No, you're perfect—I mean, your timing is perfect, not that you're perfect, but you're also—sorry, I'll just—coffee. I'll make coffee."

I turned to the drip coffee pot. I'd brewed a fresh batch an hour ago—the Costa Rican blend I keep on rotation for people who just want regular coffee without all the fussy performance art.

I poured it into Eugene's usual mug. The one with the faded logo from some bank that probably doesn't exist anymore. Didn't measure anything. Didn't think about extraction rates or optimal temperatures or terroir or whether the coffee was CORRECT.

I just poured it and handed it to him and felt like maybe I should quit everything forever.

Eugene took a sip.

"Oh," he said. "That's good."

I blinked. "Is it?"

"Rena, you always make good coffee. But today it's..." He took another sip, considering. "It's exactly what I needed today. You have this way of knowing, you know?"

I did not know.

"I lost my wife three years ago," he said, which I knew because he'd told me once, months ago, and then we never talked about it again because Eugene was from that generation that didn't excavate their feelings in public. "And Tuesdays were her day. She'd get her hair done, meet her friends for lunch. I'd have the house to myself for a few hours. I always looked forward to it—the quiet, you know? Then she was gone and Tuesdays became the hardest day."

He looked at his coffee. At me. Smiled.

"But now I come here. And you're always so happy to see me, even when you're having a hard day. And the coffee's always good. And it feels like... like someone's glad I'm here, you know?"

I was crying again. Differently this time.

"Eugene," I said.

"What?"

"I burned this batch a little. It's not technically correct at all."

He laughed—this wonderful, gravelly laugh that sounded like it came from somewhere deep and real and hard-won.

"Who cares about correct? It tastes like kindness. That's all that matters."

After Eugene left—with his generous tip, his empty mug, and the smiley face he'd drawn in the coffee residue at the bottom because he ALWAYS does that and it ALWAYS makes me tear up—I stood in my empty shop and looked at my hands.

These hands that know every variable in coffee extraction.

These hands that can measure beans to the exact gram without a scale.

These hands that just made "soulless" coffee because I was so busy trying to prove something that I forgot why I do this in the first place.

I made myself a cup. Didn't measure anything. Didn't time anything. Used the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe because I still had it out and because I actually LOVE that coffee—love its brightness, its surprising sweetness, the way it tastes like it's full of secrets.

I made it the way I used to make coffee for myself at 3 AM in my apartment when I couldn't sleep and wasn't trying to impress anyone. When it was just me and the beans and the quiet understanding that this—THIS—was what mattered.

It was the best coffee I'd had in weeks.

I sat at the counter in my empty shop, drinking imperfect coffee that tasted like freedom, and texted Jennifer: "I think I forgot why I love this."

She texted back immediately: "So remember."

Just that. Two words.

*So remember.*

First Corinthians 13:1 says, "Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."

I always thought that was about speaking. About using pretty words without meaning them.

But maybe it's about everything.

Maybe you can make technically perfect coffee—coffee that checks every box, hits every measurement, impresses every critic—and if you make it just to prove you can, it's still just noise.

Soulless. Correct but soulless.

The coffee I made for Eugene wasn't perfect. But it was made with presence. Made for HIM. Made because on Tuesdays he comes to my chaotic little shop and I'm genuinely glad to see him. Made because I care that he's here and that he lost his wife and that coffee might be the smallest comfort but maybe it's enough.

Made with charity. Which is just an old word for love.

Sterling Ashworth wanted a performance. Eugene wanted to be seen.

I can do one of those things. And I think I finally know which one actually matters.

I'm closing up now. It's 7:12 PM and getting dark earlier these days, that winter darkness that settles in before you're ready. The shop smells like coffee and possibility and something that might be hope if I let it be.

Tomorrow Sterling Ashworth will probably tell all his coffee-snob friends about the technically competent but ultimately disappointing pour-over he had at some little nobody shop downtown.

Tomorrow Eugene will come back at 11:00 AM with his newspaper and his cardigan and his broken heart that's learning to beat again.

Tomorrow I'll make coffee. For people. With presence. With heart. With whatever the opposite of soulless is.

Maybe I'll knock something over. Probably I'll knock something over.

But the coffee will be good. Not because it's correct.

Because it's mine. Made with hands that are learning to show up. Made for people who deserve to be seen.

Excellence and perfection aren't the same thing.

Turns out, I'm much better at one than the other.

And for once, THAT'S OKAY.

[^1]: This is why I get anxious about pour-overs. Too many variables. Too many ways to fail. Too much opportunity for someone to notice that you're just a girl who grew up in an IFB household and doesn't actually know what she's doing. But I digress.

[^2]: I'm always standing in puddles. This is just my life now. Jennifer says I should get those rubber mats that kitchens use. Jennifer is probably right. I keep forgetting to order them.

[^3]: First Corinthians 13:13 says "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity." Mother always said that meant being charitable to the church, to the missionaries, to the building fund. But maybe it just means showing up for people. Seeing them. Making them coffee that tastes like you're glad they exist. Maybe that's the whole thing.
