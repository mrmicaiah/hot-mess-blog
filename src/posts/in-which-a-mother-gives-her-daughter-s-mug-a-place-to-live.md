I have the coffee ready at 2:58 because Grace is never late and I am never not ready for her, and these two facts have formed a kind of covenant between us that neither of us has ever spoken out loud. Thursday. 3 PM. Small black coffee. Colombian — balanced, reliable, the kind of coffee that doesn't ask anything of you, just shows up and does its job, which is maybe why I started making it for her in the first place, though I didn't think about that until just now and I'm going to stop thinking about it because if I start drawing parallels between people and coffee profiles I will never stop and Jennifer has told me this is "a therapy thing, not a barista thing."

The bell rings at 3:00 exactly.

Grace is wearing her work clothes — the blazer, the structured bag, the posture of a woman who holds herself together professionally and has been doing so for four years with a precision that makes my chest ache if I think about it too long. She comes in. She nods. I nod. This is our liturgy.

But today she's carrying something else. A small paper bag — brown, the kind you'd get at a bakery, folded shut at the top, held against her side like she's not sure she wants anyone to notice it.

I notice it. I notice everything about Grace on Thursdays because Thursdays are sacred in a way I can't explain to people who haven't watched someone show up to grieve in your coffee shop every week for two years. I notice and I say nothing, because saying nothing is the only gift I've ever gotten right with Grace, and I'm not about to ruin my one area of competence.

She sits at the corner table. Her table. The two-person by the window with the view of St. Francis Memorial and the cemetery beyond it, which is not a coincidence and never has been. She sits facing the window. She always sits facing the window.

I bring the coffee. Set it down. Colombian, black, the cup I keep for her — the blue ceramic one with the small chip on the handle that she once touched with her thumb like she was reading Braille, and after that I never gave her a different cup.

"Thank you," she says.

"Of course."

I go back behind the counter. I wipe things. I organize beans that don't need organizing. I do the things you do when you're giving someone space while also being completely unable to stop watching them from your peripheral vision, which is a skill I have developed to a degree that is probably not healthy but is definitely useful in the service industry.

She drinks her coffee. The paper bag sits on the table beside her cup, untouched. The cemetery is gray and white through the window — February headstones under a thin layer of old snow, the kind that's been there long enough to look permanent. Grace watches it the way she always does. Not staring. Just — being with it.

3:25. She finishes the coffee. Sets the cup down. Puts both hands flat on the table, the way you do when you're steadying yourself for something.

3:30. The old leaving time. The time she always stood and nodded and walked out, every Thursday for two years, until three weeks ago when she stayed and said my name for the first time and something in the room shifted.

She doesn't leave.

She puts her hand on the paper bag.

I stop pretending to organize beans. I stop pretending I'm not watching. I just stand behind the counter, towel over my shoulder, and wait, because whatever is happening at the corner table is happening at its own pace and I have learned — slowly, imperfectly, the way I learn everything — that some moments aren't mine to rush.

Grace picks up the bag. Looks at it. Looks at the cemetery through the window. Looks at me.

"Can you come here?" she says.

I have never sat at the corner table with Grace. In two years of Thursdays, I have brought the coffee, taken the cup, and kept my distance, because that's what she needed and I am trying very hard to be the kind of person who gives people what they need instead of what I want to give them, which is usually too much information about coffee and an enthusiasm they did not ask for.

I sit down across from her. My hands are shaking slightly, which I deal with by putting them in my lap where she can't see them, except I bump my knee on the table leg on the way down and the coffee cup rattles and she steadies it with one hand without looking, like she expected it.

Maybe she did.

She slides the bag across the table toward me.

"Open it," she says.

Inside is a mug. Small, ceramic, pale yellow with a tiny painted daisy on one side — not professional, hand-done, a little uneven, the kind of thing someone made in a class or painted at one of those studios where you pick your piece and they fire it for you. The handle is thin. There's a thumbprint in the glaze on the bottom, visible, preserved, fired permanent.

"It was hers," Grace says. "Lily's."

I hold the mug with both hands. Carefully. More carefully than I have held anything in this shop, which is saying something because I have broken enough things in this building to fill a landfill, and my hands are shaking again but I am holding this mug like it is made of something more fragile than ceramic, because it is.[^1]

"She made it in college," Grace says. "A ceramics class. She was terrible at it — she'd tell you that. Everything she made was lopsided." A pause. Something moves across her face. "She kept this one. It was in her apartment. I've had it in my cabinet for four years."

The thumbprint on the bottom. Lily's thumbprint. Fired into the glaze, permanent.

"Grace —"

"I'm not giving it away," she says, and her voice is firm in the way that means it almost wasn't. "I'm giving it a place to be used. There's a difference."

I look at her. She's looking at the mug in my hands.

"She would've liked it here," Grace says. "She liked places like this — messy ones. Real ones. She would've sat at that table." She points at the student table, the six-seater with the laptops and the outlet and the younger crowd. "She would've studied here for hours and ordered too many lattes and talked to you about coffee until you were both late for something."

I am crying. I want to be clear about this — I am not tearing up, I am not getting misty, I am sitting at the corner table on a Thursday afternoon holding a dead girl's daisy mug and crying in a way that is quiet but thorough, and Grace is watching me and she is not crying, and I think that might be the most remarkable thing I've ever seen.

"Can I put it behind the counter?" I ask. "Where I can see it?"

"That's what I was hoping."

I stand up. I carry the mug to the counter. I almost drop it — my elbow catches the edge of the service bar and the mug tips in my grip and I catch it against my chest with both hands, heart slamming.

Grace watches from the corner table. And for the first time in two years of Thursdays — the first time I have ever seen it — she almost smiles.

"She was clumsy too," she says.

I put the mug on the shelf behind the counter. The shelf where I keep the things that matter — the wooden scoop Noah gave me, the laminated coffee sleeve, the small stone from the cemetery. I don't wash it first. I just put it there, with the daisy facing out, the thumbprint hidden underneath where only I'll know it's there.

Grace stays until 3:50. Twenty minutes past the old time. A new record. She doesn't say much else. She doesn't need to. She watches me put the mug on the shelf and she watches me go back to work and she finishes a second cup of coffee — a second cup, which has never happened, not once in two years — and when she leaves she stops at the door.

"Thursday," she says.

"Thursday," I say.

The bell rings. She's gone.

I stand behind the counter. The mug is on the shelf to my left. The daisy. The thumbprint underneath. A girl I never met who was clumsy and liked lopsided things and would've sat at the student table and ordered too many lattes.

Mercies are new every morning — that's what the verse says. Every morning, new. Faithfulness that doesn't run out, that shows up again, that keeps being true even when the thing you're being faithful to is a grief you thought would never let you breathe.

But Grace breathed today. She brought a mug to a coffee shop and let it live here. She stayed for a second cup. She almost smiled.

Faithfulness isn't dramatic. It's Thursday at 3 PM, every week, for two years, until the day the grief loosens just enough to let something go — not because it doesn't matter anymore, but because it matters enough to give it somewhere to be alive.[^2]

The shop is quiet. The mug is on the shelf. Thursday is over.

I make myself a Colombian. Black. In the blue cup with the chip. I stand behind the counter and drink it slow and look at the daisy mug and think about a girl named Lily who made something lopsided and beautiful in a college ceramics class and whose mother just trusted me with it.

The radiator ticks. The piano plays. The cemetery is going dark through the window.

I'm here. The mug is here.

Thursday.
