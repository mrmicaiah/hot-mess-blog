The day starts with Betsy leaking and ends with me dropping an entire carafe of cold brew on a customer's laptop, and somewhere in between there's a rush that doesn't stop for three hours and a delivery that never arrives and Jennifer calling to cancel our dinner plans because something came up, which is fine, everything is fine, except that by 7 PM when I flip the sign to CLOSED I'm so empty I can feel it in my teeth.

I don't want to go upstairs. I don't want to sit in my apartment and stare at the walls and think about all the things I did wrong today. I don't want to cook—the thought of standing at a stove makes me want to cry, which is dramatic, I know it's dramatic, but my body doesn't care about proportional responses right now.

I lock the door. I walk.

Milly's Diner is four blocks away, which is far enough that I have to decide to go there but close enough that I don't have to think too hard about the decision. It's the kind of diner that's been here forever—vinyl booths, Formica counters, a pie case by the register that's been there since before I was born. The food isn't fancy. The coffee isn't good. None of that is the point.

The bell over Milly's door is louder than mine—a real clang, not a jingle—and the smell is immediate: grease and coffee and something baking, probably pie, probably apple because it's October and Milly makes apple pie in October the way other people breathe.

She's behind the counter, same as always. Mid-fifties, gray streaking through brown hair she keeps pinned back, arms that look like they've carried things and aren't afraid to carry more. She takes one look at me standing in the doorway and doesn't smile, doesn't wave, doesn't ask how I'm doing.

"Booth four," she says. "Meatloaf's hot."

I go to booth four. I don't argue.[^1]

This is the thing about Milly: she doesn't ask questions. She assesses, decides, acts. The first time I came in here, three weeks after opening, I was so overwhelmed I couldn't read the menu. Just sat there staring at the laminated pages like they were written in a foreign language. Milly appeared with a cup of coffee—didn't ask if I wanted it, just put it down—and said, "You want the patty melt. Trust me."

I wanted the patty melt. She was right.

She's always right. Not in a pushy way, not in a Jennifer way where the enthusiasm outpaces the information. Milly's rightness is quieter than that—it's the rightness of someone who's been watching people walk through her door for thirty years and knows what tired looks like, what heartbroken looks like, what running-on-empty looks like. She doesn't need you to explain. She already knows.

The meatloaf arrives before I've taken off my jacket. Mashed potatoes, green beans from a can, gravy that's definitely from a packet. A roll that's probably frozen but somehow still warm and soft in the middle. Milly sets it down without ceremony, refills the coffee I didn't realize she'd poured, and says, "You look like you got hit by a truck."

"It was a day."

"Looks like it." She tops off the coffee again even though I haven't touched it. "Eat."

She walks away. That's it. No sympathy, no follow-up questions, no sitting down across from me to process feelings. Just food and coffee and a booth where no one needs me to be anything.

I eat.

The meatloaf is exactly what meatloaf should be—dense, savory, the kind of food that fills you up in a way that has nothing to do with nutrition and everything to do with being held. I don't know who first decided that certain foods were "comfort food," but they were right, and this is it: the food your body recognizes even if you've never had it before, the food that says you're allowed to stop now.[^2]

I think about Milly while I eat. About how little I actually know about her—no wedding ring, but that doesn't mean anything. No pictures behind the counter, but some people aren't picture people. She owns the diner, has owned it for decades, and that's the sum total of my information. I don't know where she lives. I don't know if she has kids. I don't know what she does when the diner closes, whether she goes home to someone or to silence or to a cat who ignores her.

But I know she sees me.

Not in a big way. Not in an I-know-your-story way. Just in the way that matters: she notices when I'm wrung out, and she puts food in front of me, and she doesn't make me perform okayness while I eat it. She gives me a booth and a meal and the gift of being left alone while still being watched over.

I don't know what to call that. Maternal, maybe, except my mother's love came with conditions and commentary and Milly's comes with meatloaf and silence. Maybe that's the difference between mothering and being maternal—one is about the mother, and one is about the person being cared for.

The pie arrives without me ordering it. Apple, of course. Warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting into the crust.

"I didn't—"

"I know." Milly's already walking away. "You need it."

She's right. I need it.

I eat the pie slowly, watching the ice cream turn to sweet rivers between the apples, and I think about rest. About how I'm so bad at it—how I fill every silence with productivity, every pause with planning, every empty moment with worry about what I should be doing instead. I think about how hard it is to let someone else carry things, even small things, even a decision about what to eat for dinner.

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened. I know that verse. I've known it my whole life. But I always pictured rest as something spiritual—prayer, meditation, being still before God. I didn't picture it as a diner booth and a plate of meatloaf and a woman who doesn't ask questions.

Maybe rest is just letting someone else pour for a while.

I leave cash on the table—enough for the meal plus too much tip, which Milly will complain about next time, which is part of the ritual now—and I stop at the counter on my way out.

"Thank you," I say.

Milly looks at me. Doesn't smile. "You're still tired."

"I know."

"Come back tomorrow. I'm making pot roast."

It's not a question.[^3]

I walk home in the dark, past the closed shops and the lit windows and the October air that's just starting to bite. I'm still tired. I'm still empty in places that one meal can't fill. But I'm also fed, and seen, and reminded that I don't have to do all the carrying all the time.

Sometimes you just have to show up at a diner and let Milly decide.

The apartment is quiet when I get back. I don't turn on the lights. I just sit down in the cozy chair, let my head fall back against the cushion, and close my eyes.

Tomorrow there will be coffee to make and customers to serve and probably something else to knock over. But right now, there's just this: the quiet, the dark, the meatloaf settling warm in my stomach.

It's enough.

[^1]: I've learned not to argue with Milly. It doesn't work. She has a way of looking at you that makes you feel like a child who's being ridiculous, and honestly, you usually are.

[^2]: Jennifer would say I have "food issues," which is probably true. When every meal of your childhood came with a side of commentary about your body and your choices and your spiritual state, food gets complicated. Milly's food isn't complicated. It's just food. That's the whole miracle.

[^3]: This is how Milly says "I care about you." Through pot roast and commands. I'm fluent in it now.
