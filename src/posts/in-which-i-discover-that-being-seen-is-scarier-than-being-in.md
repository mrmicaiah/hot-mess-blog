Pastor Coleman caught me after service with what he probably thought was a friendly smile.

"Rena, I've been thinking—your story is incredible. Would you consider sharing your testimony next Sunday? Just five minutes. Nothing formal."

I said yes.

I don't know why I said yes. Jennifer was standing right there nodding encouragingly, and Pastor Coleman has this way of asking questions that feel like invitations instead of pressure, and my mouth just... cooperated without consulting my brain first.

"Great!" he said. "Just share what God's done in your life. Be yourself."

Be myself. Right. The self who knocks over communion cups and once dropped an entire tray of cookies during fellowship hour.¹ That self. Perfect choice for public speaking.

I spent the next week rewriting my testimony approximately forty-seven times.

First draft: Too long. Seven pages. Pastor Coleman said five MINUTES, not five HOURS.

Second draft: Too short. "I left my old church. Got a coffee shop. The end." Jennifer read it and said, "You sound like a robot. A sad robot."

Third draft: Too theological. It was basically just a string of Bible verses connected by semicolons. Even I got bored reading it.

Fourth draft: Too casual. Jennifer said I couldn't start with "So, fun story about religious trauma—"

Fifth draft: I deleted everything and stared at a blank page for twenty minutes while having a small existential crisis.

"Just tell them what happened," Jennifer said over the phone that Thursday night. "Tell them about leaving. About The Hot Mess. About choosing freedom. Tell them the TRUTH."

"The truth is messy," I said.

"Rena. You literally named your coffee shop The Hot Mess. Lean into it."

Sunday morning arrived the way Sunday mornings do: inevitably and without mercy.

I stood in my apartment at 8:47 AM wearing jeans and an oversized sweater, holding the note cards I'd written and rewritten so many times the edges were soft. My hands were shaking. My mouth was dry. I'd already knocked over my coffee mug twice (thankfully empty both times) and I hadn't even left the apartment yet.

Romans 8:1 looped through my head on repeat: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

I could just not go.

I could text Pastor Coleman. Say I was sick. Say Betsy (my espresso machine) exploded. Say literally anything that meant I didn't have to stand in front of people and TELL THEM THINGS about myself.

But then I thought about that potluck. The one at this church, months ago, when I first saw women in jeans worshiping God. When I saw freedom and faith in the same room, in the same moment, in the same PERSON.

Someone had been brave enough to build that. To create a space where I could see what was possible.

Maybe it was my turn.

I grabbed my keys. Dropped them. Picked them up. Dropped them again. Finally got them in my pocket.

I drove to church.

---

The sanctuary felt enormous.

I'd been attending for months, but sitting in a pew is different from standing at the front with a microphone. From that angle, there were SO MANY PEOPLE. Rows and rows of faces. All looking. All waiting.

Pastor Coleman squeezed my shoulder. "You've got this. Just tell your story."

Jennifer gave me a thumbs up from the third row.

I walked to the microphone.

Dropped my note cards.

Because of course I did.

Pastor Coleman helped me pick them up. They were out of order now. I tried to reorganize them with shaking hands, realized it didn't matter, and just... started talking.

"Hi. I'm Rena. I—uh—I own The Hot Mess. The coffee shop? Downtown?"

My voice sounded weird. Too loud. Too shaky. I could hear it bouncing off the walls.

"I grew up in an Independent Fundamental Baptist church. That's—for those who don't know—that's the kind of church where women wear long skirts and rules matter more than grace and you're taught that God is mostly angry and disappointed."

I looked down at my cards. They didn't help. I looked back up.

"I wore jean skirts until I was almost thirty years old. Not because I loved them. Because I was told that jeans were immodest. That wearing pants was rebellion. That God couldn't possibly love a woman who showed the shape of her legs."

Someone in the congregation shifted. I kept talking.

"I lived at home until I was almost thirty. I was homeschooled. Only child. My parents thought the world was too dangerous, too corrupting. I had one friend growing up: Jesus. And even He felt distant because I was taught to approach Him like a judge instead of a Father."

My hands were still shaking. I gripped the sides of the podium.

"Then I met Jennifer." I gestured vaguely toward where she sat. "She invited me here. To a potluck. And I saw—"

My voice cracked. I stopped. Breathed.

"I saw women in jeans. Worshiping. Crying. Thanking God. And nobody told them they were immodest. Nobody said they were rebellious. They were just... free. And faithful. At the same time."

I looked up then. Really looked.

And I saw Maya Garcia in the fourth row wiping her eyes.

Daniel Thompson nodding like he understood.

Faces I didn't even know—softening. Opening. Some crying.

Not judgment.

Recognition.

"I realized everything I'd been taught was a lie," I said, and my voice was steadier now. "God wasn't angry. The rules weren't from Him. I could wear jeans and seek His face. I could be free and still be His daughter. And I—"

I stopped again. The truth was sitting in my chest, demanding to be said.

"I opened a coffee shop because I needed to become someone my old church said was impossible. Someone who could provide for herself. Make decisions. Build something. I called it The Hot Mess because that's exactly what I am. A hot mess. Making hot coffee. Learning to be free. Learning to be present. Learning that God's grace is bigger than every rule I was taught to follow."

I looked at my notecards. Looked back up.

"I mess up constantly. I drop things. I spill things. This morning I knocked over my coffee mug twice before I even left my apartment. But I'm HERE. Wearing jeans. Running a business. Choosing freedom. And Romans 8:1 says there is THEREFORE NOW no condemnation. Not eventually. Not after I get it right. NOW. Because Christ lives in me and God sees me through Him."

My voice was shaking again, but not from fear this time.

"If you're sitting there feeling trapped. If you were taught that God's love has conditions. If you're afraid that freedom means losing faith—it doesn't. You can be both. Free and faithful. Messy and loved. You can be exactly who God created you to be without becoming who your old church said you should be."

I realized I was crying.

"That's it. That's my testimony. Thank you."

I walked back to my seat. My legs felt like they might give out. Jennifer grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard enough to hurt.

I'd done it.

I'd stood in front of everyone and told the truth.

And I hadn't died.

After service, I tried to escape to the parking lot.

I made it approximately fifteen feet before Maya Garcia stopped me.

"I left a legalistic church too," she said, tears streaming down her face. "Two years ago. I've been too ashamed to talk about it. But you just—thank you."

Then Daniel Thompson: "I've been too scared to pursue my dream. I keep hearing my father's voice saying I can't. But you did it anyway."

Then a young couple: "We almost left the faith entirely because we thought it was all rules and judgment. We needed to hear this."

Then more people. And more. A parade of stories. Of recognition. Of "me too" and "I needed this" and "thank you for being brave."

I stood there nodding and crying and probably saying "thank you" seventeen times in a row.

Then Eleanor Mitchell approached.

She was older—maybe seventy?—with silver hair and kind eyes and she moved slowly, deliberately, like she was carrying something fragile.

"I've been a Christian for sixty years," she said, her voice quiet. "Sixty years. And you just gave me permission to start over."

I stared at her.

"I thought I was too old," she continued. "Too set in my ways. I thought the rules I learned as a girl were just... how it had to be. But you—" Her voice broke. "You showed me freedom isn't age-dependent. Neither is grace."

She hugged me. I hugged her back. We stood there crying in the church lobby while people moved around us.

When she pulled away, she smiled. "Thank you, dear. You have no idea what you've given me."

Then she walked away, and I stood there trying to process what had just happened.

---

I made it to the bathroom before I completely fell apart.

I was standing in front of the sink, hyperventilating, when Jennifer found me.

"Hey," she said softly. "You okay?"

"Seven people just told me I changed their life," I said, and my voice sounded hysterical even to me. "SEVEN. I didn't—I'm not qualified to change anyone's life. I'm barely qualified to make coffee without spilling it."

Jennifer handed me paper towels. I took them.

"That woman was SIXTY YEARS OLD and I gave her permission to start over. What if I can't—what if I can't do it again? What if that was a fluke? What if—"

"Rena."

Jennifer's voice was calm. Steady.

"You didn't change their lives. You just told the truth. That's all you did."

"That's the scariest thing I've ever done," I whispered.

"I know," Jennifer said. "You did it anyway."

We stood there. Me crying. Jennifer waiting.

Finally, I whispered: "That woman was sixty years old and I gave her permission to start over."

"Yeah," Jennifer said. "You did."

I looked up at her. "What if I can't do it again?"

Jennifer smiled. "You don't have to. You just had to do it once. That's how courage works."

Here's what I'm learning about being seen:

It's terrifying. More terrifying than staying hidden. More terrifying than keeping your story to yourself where it's safe and small and can't hurt anyone.

But here's the other thing: your story isn't just yours.

It's also everyone's who needs to hear it.

Eleanor Mitchell needed to hear that freedom doesn't have an expiration date. Maya Garcia needed to hear that shame doesn't have to be permanent. Daniel Thompson needed to hear that fear doesn't have the final word.

And I needed to hear—to really, truly internalize—that my mess is my message.

Not in spite of the mess. BECAUSE of it.

Because when you stand up and say "I'm still figuring this out and I drop things and I'm scared but I'm doing it anyway"—that gives other people permission to be figuring it out too.

The Hot Mess isn't just a coffee shop.

It's a philosophy. A theology. A way of moving through the world that says: come as you are, mess and all, and we'll make something beautiful together anyway.

I'm still scared. I'm still anxious. I'm still dropping things and knocking things over and standing in puddles without realizing it.²

But I'm also seen now.

Really seen.

And maybe that's the whole point of testimony: not to be perfect, but to be present. To show up with your truth and trust that God will use it.

Even if your hands shake.

Even if you drop your notecards.

Even if you're standing in front of a church full of people wearing jeans your mother would call immodest.

Especially then.

Because there's someone in the room who needs to know they're not alone.

And maybe that someone is a sixty-year-old woman who thought it was too late.

Or maybe that someone is you.

¹ The cookies survived. My dignity did not.

² Jennifer says I've made "standing in puddles without noticing" into an art form. She's not wrong.

³ Romans 8:1. Always Romans 8:1. I've probably quoted it five hundred times since moving out. It still works.
