Pastor Coleman caught me after service with what he probably thought was a friendly smile.

"Rena, I've been thinking—your story is incredible. Would you consider sharing your testimony next Sunday? Just five minutes. Nothing formal."

I said yes.

I don't know why I said yes. Jennifer was standing right there nodding encouragingly, and Pastor Coleman has this way of asking questions that feel like invitations instead of pressure, and my mouth just... cooperated without consulting my brain first.

"Great!" he said. "Just share what God's done in your life. Be yourself."

Be myself. Right. The self who knocks over communion cups and once dropped an entire tray of cookies during fellowship hour.[^1] That self. Perfect choice for public speaking.

I spent the next week rewriting my testimony approximately forty-seven times.

First draft: Too long. Seven pages. Pastor Coleman said five MINUTES, not five HOURS.

Second draft: Too short. "I left my old church. Got a coffee shop. The end." Jennifer read it and said, "You sound like a robot. A sad robot."

Third draft: Too theological. It was basically just a string of Bible verses connected by semicolons. Even I got bored reading it.

Fourth draft: Too casual. Jennifer said I couldn't start with "So, fun story about religious trauma—"

Fifth draft: I deleted everything and stared at a blank page for twenty minutes while having a small existential crisis.

"Just tell them what happened," Jennifer said over the phone that Thursday night. "Tell them about leaving. About The Hot Mess. About choosing freedom. Tell them the TRUTH."

"The truth is messy," I said.

"Rena. You literally named your coffee shop The Hot Mess. Lean into it."

Sunday morning arrived the way Sunday mornings do: inevitably and without mercy.

I stood in my apartment at 8:47 AM wearing jeans and an oversized sweater, holding the note cards I'd written and rewritten so many times the edges were soft. My hands were shaking. My mouth was dry. I'd already knocked over my coffee mug twice (thankfully empty both times) and I hadn't even left the apartment yet.

Romans 8:1 looped through my head on repeat: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

I could just not go.

But then I thought about that potluck. The one at this church, months ago, when I first saw women in jeans worshiping God. When I saw freedom and faith in the same room, in the same moment, in the same PERSON.

Someone had been brave enough to build that. To create a space where I could see what was possible.

Maybe it was my turn.

I grabbed my keys. Dropped them. Picked them up. Dropped them again. Finally got them in my pocket.

I drove to church.

The sanctuary felt enormous.

I walked to the microphone. Dropped my note cards. Because of course I did.

Pastor Coleman helped me pick them up. They were out of order now. I tried to reorganize them with shaking hands, realized it didn't matter, and just... started talking.

"Hi. I'm Rena. I—uh—I own The Hot Mess. The coffee shop? Downtown?"

"I grew up in an Independent Fundamental Baptist church. That's—for those who don't know—that's the kind of church where women wear long skirts and rules matter more than grace and you're taught that God is mostly angry and disappointed."

"I wore jean skirts until I was almost thirty years old. Not because I loved them. Because I was told that jeans were immodest. That wearing pants was rebellion."

"Then I met Jennifer. She invited me here. To a potluck. And I saw—"

My voice cracked. I stopped. Breathed.

"I saw women in jeans. Worshiping. Crying. Thanking God. And nobody told them they were immodest. Nobody said they were rebellious. They were just... free. And faithful. At the same time."

I looked up then. Really looked.

And I saw Maya Garcia in the fourth row wiping her eyes. Daniel Thompson nodding like he understood. Faces I didn't even know—softening. Opening. Some crying.

Not judgment. Recognition.

"I opened a coffee shop because I needed to become someone my old church said was impossible. Someone who could provide for herself. Make decisions. Build something. I called it The Hot Mess because that's exactly what I am. A hot mess. Making hot coffee. Learning to be free."

"If you're sitting there feeling trapped. If you were taught that God's love has conditions. If you're afraid that freedom means losing faith—it doesn't. You can be both. Free and faithful. Messy and loved."

I realized I was crying.

"That's it. That's my testimony. Thank you."

After service, I tried to escape to the parking lot.

I made it approximately fifteen feet before Maya Garcia stopped me.

"I left a legalistic church too," she said, tears streaming down her face. "Two years ago. I've been too ashamed to talk about it. But you just—thank you."

Then more people. And more. A parade of stories. Of recognition.

Then Eleanor Mitchell approached. She was older—maybe seventy?—with silver hair and kind eyes.

"I've been a Christian for sixty years," she said, her voice quiet. "Sixty years. And you just gave me permission to start over."

She hugged me. We stood there crying in the church lobby.

"Thank you, dear. You have no idea what you've given me."

Here's what I'm learning about being seen:

It's terrifying. More terrifying than staying hidden.

But here's the other thing: your story isn't just yours.

It's also everyone's who needs to hear it.

Eleanor Mitchell needed to hear that freedom doesn't have an expiration date. Maya Garcia needed to hear that shame doesn't have to be permanent.

And I needed to hear—to really, truly internalize—that my mess is my message.

Not in spite of the mess. BECAUSE of it.

I'm still scared. I'm still dropping things and standing in puddles without realizing it.[^2]

But I'm also seen now.

Really seen.

And maybe that's the whole point of testimony: not to be perfect, but to be present.

[^1]: The cookies survived. My dignity did not.

[^2]: Jennifer says I've made "standing in puddles without noticing" into an art form. She's not wrong.
