The father is maybe sixty, with a gray beard and the kind of hands that look like they've built things. He's helping his daughter carry boxes to her car—she just graduated, she told me earlier, moving to her first apartment, terrified and thrilled in equal measure. He hasn't said much. Just carried boxes. Held doors. Stood back while she said goodbye to friends who stopped by for coffee.

Now he's loading her trunk, arranging things so they'll fit, and she's watching him with this look on her face that I recognize because I've worn it. The look that says: I don't know how to thank you for something this big, so I'm just going to stand here and hope you know.

He closes the trunk. She hugs him. He pats her back twice—awkward, loving, insufficient—and then she gets in the car and drives away, and he stands in my parking lot for a long moment before walking to his own truck.

I'm behind the counter, cloth in hand, frozen mid-wipe.

And suddenly I'm not here anymore.

Moving day was hot. August hot, the kind where the air feels like something you have to push through. I'd been packing for a week, putting my whole life into boxes that didn't look like enough to hold it, and Dad showed up at 7 AM with his truck and his silence and his hands that have built things my whole life.

Mom wasn't coming out. She stayed in the kitchen, and we both pretended that was fine.

He carried boxes. I carried boxes. We didn't talk about what was happening or why or what it meant that I was leaving the only home I'd ever known to open a coffee shop in a town twenty minutes away. We just moved things from the house to the truck, the truck to the car, my whole childhood measured in how many trips it took.[^1]

I was wearing jeans.

I hadn't thought about it. I'd been wearing jeans for three weeks by then—just around the apartment I was moving into, just when I was alone, just to see if the world would end. It didn't. So I kept wearing them. And that morning, loading boxes, sweating in the August heat, I forgot that I was wearing them in front of him.

He didn't say anything.

That was the worst part. He saw them—I watched him see them, watched his eyes move down and then back up—and his face did something I couldn't read. Not angry. Not disappointed. Something else. Something that looked like sadness, or maybe grief, or maybe just the recognition that his daughter had become someone he didn't fully recognize anymore.

He kept carrying boxes.

I kept carrying boxes.

And I've been holding that look for three months now, turning it over in my mind like a stone I can't put down. What did it mean? What did he think when he saw me? Did he go home and tell Mom? Did they talk about me, about how I'd changed, about whether they'd lost me?

I don't know. I've never asked. Asking would mean admitting that it hurt, and admitting that it hurt would mean admitting that I still need his approval even though I left to stop needing it, and that's a knot I don't know how to untie.

The man in the parking lot gets in his truck. Drives away. His daughter is gone, off to her new life, and he's going home to whatever home looks like when your kid isn't in it anymore.

I put down the cloth.

The shop is empty—mid-afternoon lull, that quiet hour when the morning rush is done and the evening crowd hasn't started. I make myself a cup of coffee without thinking about it, just letting my hands do what they know how to do, and it isn't until I take the first sip that I realize what I've made.

Medium roast. Black. No fuss, no flavoring, no foam.

Dad's coffee.

I made Mom's coffee last week, the day her package came. Now I'm making Dad's. My hands keep reaching for them even when my head doesn't know it's happening.[^2]

I take another sip. It's good. Simple. Honest. The kind of coffee that doesn't need anything added to be enough.

I pull out my phone.

The photo takes four tries because I keep dropping my phone, which is very on-brand. The final version is blurry and off-center, my thumb slightly visible in the corner, the coffee cup looking more like a vague brown suggestion than an actual beverage. I send it anyway, no caption, no explanation.

Three dots appear. Disappear. Appear again.

Then: a photo. Biscuits on a baking sheet, equally blurry, equally off-center. His thumb in the corner too.

No words. No "I love you." No "I'm proud of you." No "I'm sorry I looked at your jeans like that."

Just biscuits.

I laugh, and it comes out wet, and I'm crying at my own counter in my own shop over a blurry photo of biscuits, because that's how Champions talk. That's how we've always talked. Not with words, which are too direct, too vulnerable, too much. With food. With showing up. With hands that carry boxes and mouths that stay closed and photos sent across twenty minutes of distance that might as well be twenty years.

*Bear with each other and forgive one another.*

I used to think forgiveness was a conversation. A clearing of the air. An apology given and accepted, both parties walking away lighter. But maybe it's not. Maybe forgiveness is just continuing to show up. Continuing to send photos. Continuing to love someone whose love has limits, because all love has limits, and the only question is whether you can live inside them.

Dad looked at my jeans and something in his face broke a little.

I saw it, and something in my chest broke a little.

And we're both still here. Still sending biscuits. Still showing up at 7 AM with trucks and silence and hands that carry things even when we don't have words for what we're carrying.

That's not nothing.

I finish the coffee. Wash the cup. Put it back on the shelf.

The afternoon light is shifting, golden and slow, and soon the evening crowd will come and I'll make lattes and cortados and explain the difference between Ethiopian and Guatemalan to someone who didn't ask, and the day will keep going the way days do.

But right now, I'm standing in my shop, looking at a blurry photo of biscuits, and I'm okay.

We're okay.

Not fixed. Not finished. But okay.
