The list is six items long.

Inventory the backup milk supply. Email the roaster about next month's order. Call the plumber about the leak under the sink that I've been "monitoring" for three weeks, which is a generous way of saying I put a bucket under it and hoped it would heal itself. Wipe down the menu boards. Reorganize the book exchange shelf, which has devolved into chaos since someone donated an entire collection of romance novels with shirtless men on the covers.[^1] Update the social media I keep forgetting I have.

Six items. All reasonable. All waiting.

I make myself a pour-over instead.

It's Tuesday afternoon, that strange pocket of time between the lunch rush that wasn't much of a rush and the after-work crowd that won't materialize for hours. The shop is empty except for Walter at the corner table, same as every Tuesday, drip coffee in front of him, gaze fixed on the cemetery through the window. Snow is falling in that lazy, uncommitted way that might amount to something or might not. The piano hymns are soft through the speakers. The espresso machine hums its idle hum.

I measure the beans. Grind them. The sound fills the shop for exactly nineteen seconds—I've counted before, because of course I have—and then silence returns, thicker somehow for having been broken.

The pour-over is a slow process. That's the point. You can't rush it. The water has to be the right temperature, the pour has to be steady, the bloom has to happen in its own time. I used to find this frustrating, back when I thought everything had to be optimized, efficient, earned. Now I find it... necessary.

The list can wait.

I pour. Watch the water spiral. Watch the coffee drip into the cup below, dark and steady. When it's done, I take it to the counter and sit on the stool I almost never use because I'm always moving, always wiping something or restocking something or apologizing for something I've knocked over.

I sit.

Walter doesn't look up. He doesn't need to. We've been doing this dance for over a year now—him at his table, me behind my counter, both of us occupying the same space without requiring anything from each other. He's never asked me to perform competence or cheerfulness or even conversation. He just comes, drinks his coffee, watches the cemetery, leaves a smiley face in the residue at the bottom of his cup.

It's the most peaceful relationship I have.

The snow is accumulating now, just barely, a thin white line forming on the windowsill. I watch it the way Walter watches the headstones—not looking for anything, just looking. My coffee is warm in my hands. The list exists somewhere in the back of my mind, but it's quieter now, less urgent. The milk inventory will still be there in an hour. The leak will still be leaking. The shirtless romance novels will still be scandalizing the book exchange shelf.

None of it requires me to move right now.

This is harder than it sounds. Stillness, I mean. My whole life was motion—the right kind of motion, the productive kind, the kind that proved I was useful and therefore allowed to exist. Idle hands, devil's workshop, all of that. I learned to fill every silence with effort, every pause with purpose. Rest was what happened when you'd finished everything, which meant rest never happened, because the list never ends. There's always another thing.

But Matthew 11 says come. Not finish first. Not earn it. Just come, all you who are weary.

I'm weary.

So I sit.

Walter shifts in his chair, lifts his cup, drinks. Sets it down. The snow falls. A car passes outside, tires shushing through the slush, and then quiet again. Betsy hums. The hymn changes to another hymn, equally soft. I drink my coffee and it tastes like coffee—good, simple, unspectacular. Nothing I need to explain or defend or improve.

Twenty minutes pass. Maybe more. I don't check my phone.

And somewhere in the stillness, I realize: I haven't knocked anything over. Haven't tripped, bumped, spilled, or catastrophically rearranged any part of the physical world. My hands are steady on the cup. My feet are planted on the floor. I'm here, fully here, in a way I almost never am.

I almost smile.

It won't last. I know that. The minute I stand up, I'll probably hip-check the counter and send a stack of napkins flying. That's who I am. But for right now, in this window of stillness, I'm just a woman drinking coffee in her own shop on a snowy Tuesday, and that's enough.

Walter finishes his cup. I see him trace something in the bottom with his finger—the smiley face, his signature, his small gift to whoever washes the dishes. He stands, puts on his coat, lifts a hand in my direction.

"Tuesday," he says.

"Tuesday," I agree.

The bell chimes as he leaves. Snow swirls in through the open door, just for a moment, and then settles.

I stay on my stool. The list is still six items long. The leak is still leaking. The romance novels are still doing whatever romance novels do when left unsupervised.

But I don't move. Not yet.

The snow falls. The coffee cools. And I rest.
