Jennifer texted me at 7:43 AM on a Tuesday, which should have been my first warning sign.

Nobody texts good news at 7:43 AM on a Tuesday. That's the time slot reserved for dental appointment reminders and texts from your mother that just say "Call me" with no context, which is basically emotional terrorism.

**Jennifer:** I signed us up for line dancing!

**Jennifer:** Beginner class! Tuesday nights!

**Jennifer:** It's going to be SO FUN

**Jennifer:** You're going to love it

**Jennifer:** Please don't say no

**Jennifer:** I already paid

I stared at my phone. Then I stared at my coffee. Then I stared at my phone again, hoping the words would rearrange themselves into something less terrifying, like "I signed us up for a calm evening of sitting quietly" or "I enrolled us in a class where we learn to remain motionless."

Dancing.

*Dancing.*

I should explain something: I have, at last count, knocked over approximately 412 things since moving into my apartment ten months ago. I have walked into doorframes I was looking directly at. I have tripped over nothing—not something, NOTHING—in the middle of a completely flat, obstacle-free floor.

And Jennifer wants me to dance. In public. With other humans. Humans I could potentially injure.

I called her immediately.

"No," I said, before she could say hello.

"Yes," she said, because Jennifer has never met a boundary she couldn't cheerfully steamroll. "It's beginner line dancing at the community center. For people who've never danced before. You'll be fine."

The Maplewood Community Center smelled like industrial floor cleaner and accumulated decades of potluck dinners. There were maybe fifteen people milling around. Average age: somewhere between "my parents" and "actually lived through the moon landing." Most were wearing actual cowboy boots.

And then the instructor walked in. She was maybe seventy, with silver hair cut short, wearing a t-shirt that said "I CAN'T, I HAVE DANCE" in sparkly letters.

"I'm Hazel. I've been teaching line dancing for thirty-two years, which means I've seen every possible way a person can mess up a grapevine. You're not going to scare me."

By the end of the first song, I had stepped on three different people's feet, gone left when everyone went right four times, and apologized approximately forty-seven times.

I fled to the bathroom.

The fluorescent lights were buzzing. I gripped the sink and stared at my red face in the mirror.

*"You can't do this,"* the voice in my head said. *"You're making a fool of yourself. Just quit. Go home."*

The bathroom door opened. Hazel walked in.

"Thought I might find you in here," she said.

"I'm fine. Just needed a minute."

"Let me tell you something. 1987. County fair. I fell off the stage. Broke my ankle in two places. Three hundred people watched. Someone laughed. I spent four months convinced I'd never dance again."

"But you're still teaching."

"Got back up. I realized I wasn't dancing for the people watching. I was dancing because moving made me feel alive."

She squeezed my arm. "You don't have to be good at something to enjoy it. You just have to show up."

Something cracked open in my chest.

"My mother used to say dancing was sinful," I heard myself say. "A vertical expression of a horizontal desire."

Hazel snorted. "That's ridiculous. Dancing is just moving your body to music. There's nothing sinful about joy."

*There's nothing sinful about joy.*

No condemnation for being bad at line dancing. No condemnation for enjoying my body. For letting it be something other than a burden to apologize for.

I went back the next week. Still terrible.

But here's the thing: I was laughing.

Not nervous laughter. Actual laughter—the kind that bubbles up when something is genuinely fun.

Week three. Week four. Week five.

When I was dancing—badly, always badly—I couldn't think. The music was too loud. The steps were too fast. There wasn't room for the anxious voice.

There was just: step, step, turn, touch.

My body, moving. Not perfectly. But *present.*

For the first time in maybe my entire life, I was actually *in* my body instead of trying to escape it.

The thing about freedom nobody tells you is that it comes in stages.

First it's the big stuff—moving out, wearing jeans, making your own choices about coffee at unreasonable hours.

But then there's another layer. Freedoms you didn't even know you needed.

Freedom to fail in public. Freedom to be bad at something and keep doing it anyway. Freedom to feel joy in your own skin.

I still can't dance. Ask anyone. Ask Hazel—she positions me in the back corner for a reason.

But every Tuesday night, I show up. I move. I mess up. I laugh.

And somewhere in the middle of all that beautiful, imperfect chaos—I'm learning something I never knew I needed to learn.

My body isn't the enemy.

It's just been waiting for permission to dance.
