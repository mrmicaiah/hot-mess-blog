The bell rings at 2:47 on a Tuesday, which means Walter.

I know this the way I know that Brazilian medium roast smells like hazelnuts and honesty, the way I know the third floorboard creaks, the way I know my own hands. Walter comes on Tuesdays. Walter orders drip. Walter sits at the counter and watches me work and says almost nothing, and somehow that's exactly right.

"Afternoon," he says.

"Afternoon," I say back, already reaching for his mug—the blue one with the chip on the handle that he never mentions but always gets.

I've been in my head all morning. There's a new place two towns over. Pressed & Proper. I looked at their Instagram last night, which was a mistake, because their Instagram looks like it was designed by people who went to design school and also possibly live inside a magazine. Exposed beam ceilings. Matching ceramic cups. A pour-over bar with copper fixtures. Their latte art looks like it belongs in a museum.

Their latte art has shading.

I pour Walter's coffee and manage to spill grounds on my apron in the process, because of course I do. The coffee itself is perfect—it always is—but the grounds are now decorating my front like tiny brown confetti, and I don't even bother brushing them off anymore.

"Brazilian today," I tell him, sliding the mug across. "Same roast as last week. Marcus had a good batch."

Walter nods. He wraps both hands around the mug like he's holding something precious, which maybe he is. Coffee's not nothing. People forget that.

I make myself a cup too, because the shop is empty and the afternoon light is coming through the window at that angle that makes everything look like a painting, and I'm still thinking about Pressed & Proper and their copper fixtures and their shading.

"You're somewhere else today," Walter says.

I blink. Walter doesn't usually—he's not a words person. He's a presence person. He shows up. He drinks his coffee. He draws a smiley face in the residue at the bottom of his cup, and I pretend not to notice, and we have an understanding.

"Sorry," I say. "Just thinking."

"About?"

I shouldn't unload on customers. I know this. Jennifer has told me this. "Rena," she said once, "not everyone needs to know about your existential spirals." Which is fair. But Walter asked, and his face is patient, and the shop is empty, and the words fall out before I can catch them.

"There's this new place. Two towns over. It's—" I gesture vaguely, like the air can explain what I mean. "They have copper fixtures, Walter. Matching cups. Their whole aesthetic is—it's cohesive. And I'm standing here with coffee grounds on my apron and mismatched furniture and a book exchange that started because I forgot to return someone's lost paperback."

I'm spiraling. I can hear myself spiraling. I take a breath.

"I just wonder sometimes if this is..." I trail off. *Enough* feels like the wrong word and also exactly the right one.

Walter takes a sip of his coffee. Sets it down. Looks at me with those eyes that have seen probably seven decades of everything.

"You know why I come here?" he asks.

I don't, actually. I've never asked. He just started showing up about three months after I opened, and he's never missed a Tuesday since.

"The coffee?" I try.

"The coffee's good," he agrees. "But that other place—the nice one on Fifth, with the machines—their coffee's good too." He takes another sip. "I went there once. Sat down. Looked around." He shrugs, this small movement that carries something bigger. "Wasn't home."

I don't say anything.

"This place," he says, "is home. Because it's yours. You're in every crooked picture frame. Every sticky note in those books. That—" he points at the bulletin board, at Romans 8:1 pinned in the center, "—that's not decoration. That's you." He looks back at me. "Can't get that from copper fixtures."

The afternoon light is still doing its painting thing. The bell isn't ringing. It's just me and Walter and the smell of Brazilian medium roast and something settling in my chest that feels like permission.

*"I have learned," Paul wrote, "in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content."*

I never understood that verse until right now. I thought contentment meant having enough. But maybe it means recognizing enough. Maybe it means standing in your own coffee shop with grounds on your apron and a chipped mug in front of the only customer who matters at 2:47 on a Tuesday, and knowing—really knowing—that this is yours.

This mess. This place. This life.

Mine.

Walter finishes his coffee. Draws the smiley face. Leaves his usual two dollars on the counter, which is too much for drip and not enough for what he just gave me.

The bell rings as he goes.

I stay at the counter, holding my cup, wearing my grounds, watching the light move across the floor.

I don't brush the grounds off.

I don't need to be Pressed & Proper.

I just need to be here.
