The bell rings at 2:47 PM on a Thursday, and my father is standing in my coffee shop.

No warning text. No "stopping by later" or "need anything from town?" Just David Champion in the doorway, wearing his work jacket, looking around the space like he's cataloging it—the exposed brick, the mismatched tables, the community bulletin board with Romans 8:1 pinned in the center.

My stomach does something complicated.

"Dad." I'm holding a portafilter. I don't remember picking it up. "Hi. What are you—is everything okay? Is Mom—"

"Everything's fine." He walks to the counter, slow and deliberate, the way he does everything. "Your mother's fine. I was in the area."

He wasn't in the area. There's nothing in this area that would bring him here. His work is twenty minutes the other direction, and the only thing between his office and my shop is Grace Community Church and a gas station he doesn't use because he's loyal to the Sunoco near home.

But I don't say any of that.

"Can I get you something? Coffee? I have—" I'm already spiraling through the menu, trying to figure out what he'd want, what would impress him, whether I should suggest the single-origin pour-over or if that would sound pretentious— "I have drip. Fresh pot."

"Drip's fine. Black."

I pour him a cup. Colombian, the good stuff, fresh-roasted from Riverside last week. He won't know the difference between this and Folgers, probably, but I know, and I want him to have the best thing I can give him even if he never realizes what it is.

He takes the mug. Sits at the counter. Doesn't say anything else.

I stand there, holding the coffee pot, completely unsure what to do with my hands or my face or the rest of my body.[^1]

The afternoon trickle starts around 3:00—a few regulars, a couple I don't recognize who order matching vanilla lattes, a med student from the hospital across the street who needs a triple shot and looks like she hasn't slept in three days.

I make their drinks. Take their money. Smile and say the things you say.

And the whole time, I feel him watching.

Not staring—Dad doesn't stare. But present. Attentive. His eyes following my hands as I tamp the espresso, steam the milk, pour the shots. Watching me work in this space I built, this life I chose, this thing he never would have chosen for me but didn't stop me from choosing.

I keep waiting for the criticism. For the quiet disapproval, the suggestion that maybe I should have stuck with something more stable, the weighted silence that says more than words ever could. I've been waiting for it since I moved out—the moment he finally says what he's thinking, finally admits that I've disappointed him, finally confirms what I've always suspected.

The moment doesn't come.

He just drinks his coffee. Watches. Stays.

And I think: maybe this is what patience looks like. Not the passive kind, not sitting still while life happens around you, but the active kind. The staying-present kind. The showing-up-without-knowing-how-it-ends kind. Maybe we're both doing it right now—him and me—waiting to see what grows in the space between us.

Around 3:30, I make a cortado for a guy in a peacoat who's very particular about foam density, and I nail it—the microfoam perfect, the ratio exact, the whole thing a tiny work of art in a four-ounce glass. The guy takes a picture before he drinks it, which is annoying but also kind of flattering, and when I look up, Dad's watching with an expression I can't quite read.

Something in his face that looks almost like—

He glances away before I can name it.

I knock over the knock box, sending a puck of used espresso grounds across the counter and onto my shoes. Because of course I do.

"Sorry," I say, grabbing a towel, face burning. "I do that. A lot. The knocking things over part. You'd think I'd learn, but—"

"Rena."

I stop. Look at him.

"The coffee," he says. "It's good."

Three words. That's all. But he's not talking about what's in his mug.

He finishes his second cup at 4:15. I didn't charge him for the refill because he's my father and also because I don't know how to charge my father for coffee. The whole concept feels absurd—taking money from the man who paid for my braces and my homeschool curriculum and sixteen years of Sunday shoes I outgrew every six months.

He stands. Reaches for his wallet.

"Dad, no. It's on me."

"Rena—"

"Please." My voice comes out smaller than I intended. "Let me."

He looks at me for a long moment. Then he puts his wallet away.

"I should get back," he says. "Your mother's expecting me for dinner."

"Okay." I'm gripping the counter. I don't know why I'm gripping the counter. "Thanks for stopping by. It was—I'm glad you—"

I don't finish the sentence. Don't know how.

He nods. Turns toward the door. And then, with his hand on the frame, he stops.

"The jeans," he says, not looking at me.

My whole body goes still. The jeans. The look he gave me, months ago, when he came to help with furniture. The silent disapproval that devastated me for weeks.

"I'm sorry about that," he says. "The way I looked at you."

I can't breathe.

"You're doing good work here." He's still not looking at me, still facing the door, but his voice is steady. "I see that."

And then he's gone. Bell chiming. Door closing. His truck starting in the parking spot out front.

I stand there holding his empty mug, and I don't realize I'm crying until a tear lands on my hand.[^2]

The shop is quiet after he leaves. Late afternoon lull, golden light through the windows, just me and the hum of Betsy and the ghost of a conversation I never expected to have.

*I see that.*

He sees. He came here to see. Not because he was in the area, not because he needed something, but because he wanted to watch his daughter work. Wanted to understand what she built. Wanted to sit in her space and drink her coffee and witness her life.

And then he apologized. For a look. For a moment months ago that he probably thought I'd forgotten, that I definitely hadn't forgotten, that had lived in my chest like a splinter ever since.

He noticed. He remembered. He said it out loud.

I wash his mug by hand, even though the dishwasher's right there, because it feels important to do this slowly. To hold the thing he held. To let the moment settle.

Progress doesn't announce itself, I'm learning. It doesn't send a text first. It just shows up on a Thursday afternoon, orders drip coffee, and says four words that change everything.

*I see that.*

Yeah, Dad.

I see you too.

[^2]: The mug is fine. I'm a disaster, but the mug is fine.
