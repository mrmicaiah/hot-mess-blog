I woke up at 7:23 AM on Christmas morning in my apartment above The Hot Mess, and my first thought was: *I'm fine with this.*

My second thought was: *I need to be fine with this.*

My third thought was a very detailed plan involving coffee, the cozy chair Linda sent me (irony not lost), and maybe watching *It's a Wonderful Life* in my pajamas because nobody could stop me. I'd made peace with spending Christmas alone. Really. I'd Romans 8:1'd myself through it last night—there is therefore NOW no condemnation, even for daughters who choose coffee shops over Christmas morning with their parents.[^1]

I was fine.

I was drinking my coffee (perfect, because I made it), sitting in Linda's chair (the soft oversized one she sent three months ago without a note), wearing my rattiest pajama pants and an oversized t-shirt, and I was FINE.

Then someone knocked on my door.

At 8:04 AM.

On Christmas morning.

I opened the door in my pajamas, hair doing that thing where half of it escapes the ponytail and the other half pretends to cooperate, no glasses on (couldn't find them), and there was my father.

Standing in the hallway.

Holding a thermos and a small wrapped box.

"Your mother made cinnamon rolls," he said. Quiet. The way Dad always was. "I made coffee. Can I come in?"

I stepped back. Nodded. Couldn't find words because they were all tangled up somewhere between *you came* and *you're here* and *is this real?*

He walked into my tiny living room—the one I'd been so carefully arranging for maximum "I'm doing fine alone" aesthetic—and he looked around. Not judging. Just... seeing. The coffee shop was closed for Christmas, and the whole building was quiet except for the radiator doing its clicking-humming thing and my heart doing its own complicated percussion solo.

"I'll get mugs," I managed.

"Already brought them." He pulled two travel mugs from his coat pocket. Coleman Construction mugs—the kind Jack had made for the church building committee last year. Dad worked with Jack. Of course he had these mugs.

Of course he'd thought of everything.

---

We sat in my tiny living room—me curled in Linda's chair, Dad on the mismatched bench I'd gotten from the thrift store—and he opened the thermos.

The coffee was terrible.

Not "bad" terrible. Not "I can't drink this" terrible. But definitely "Dad tried to make coffee the way he remembered me making it and got approximately 40% of the steps right" terrible. Too weak. Wrong temperature. Possibly made in the same pot he uses for his own coffee, which means it had 30 years of Champion Coffee Method embedded in the metal.[^2]

"It's good," I lied.

Dad looked at me over his mug. Didn't say anything. Just looked.

Champion men don't call you out on your lies. They just let you know they know. Quietly.

I drank the terrible coffee. He'd driven here on Christmas morning. He'd tried to make coffee. He'd BROUGHT the coffee. I was going to drink every drop and pretend it was perfect.

We ate Linda's cinnamon rolls. They were perfect. Buttery. Sticky-sweet with cinnamon sugar. Still warm from the container Dad had wrapped them in. I'd forgotten how good Linda's Christmas cinnamon rolls were. Or maybe I'd remembered and just couldn't let myself think about it.

"Your mother wanted you to have these," Dad said.

I nodded. Couldn't speak. Christmas cinnamon rolls are how Linda says things she can't say out loud.

---

We sat there for maybe twenty minutes, eating cinnamon rolls and drinking terrible coffee, and Dad told me about work—Jack had a big project coming up, they'd need to hire two more guys. He told me about the church Christmas Eve service—they'd done all the old hymns, someone's kid had knocked over the nativity manger during "Silent Night." He told me the Johnsons' dog had gotten into Linda's kitchen trash and eaten an entire pan of fudge, and they'd had to take the dog to the emergency vet.

Normal things. Regular things. The kind of conversation we used to have before everything changed.

And then he looked down at his mug, and then at the small wrapped box he'd set on the coffee table when he came in.

"Mom wanted you to have this," he said. "She can't say it, but she wanted me to bring it today."

I picked up the box. Small. Light. Wrapped in paper printed with poinsettias. Linda wrapped it. I knew because she always folded the corners precisely, like origami.

Inside was my grandmother's cross necklace.

The delicate gold one I'd seen Grandma wear every single day until she died when I was eleven. The one that used to catch the light when she leaned down to hug me and called me "Rena LeeAnn" like it was the most beautiful name in the world.

I couldn't breathe.

"She wanted you to have it," Dad said again. Quieter this time. "When you were ready. She thinks—" He stopped. Started over. "She thinks maybe you're ready now."

*She thinks.* Not *I think.* But she'd sent it. Through Dad. On Christmas morning.

Linda couldn't say *I love you, even though I don't understand.* But she could send Grandma's necklace. The one that meant *you're seen, you're loved, you're mine.*

I put it on. My hands were shaking and I couldn't get the clasp right and Dad didn't offer to help because Champion people don't touch unless it's the exact right moment and this wasn't it. But I got it clasped eventually, and the weight of it settled against my collarbone like a memory made solid.

"Thank you," I whispered.

Dad nodded. Looked away. Looked back.

That's when he saw my jeans.

They were hanging on the back of the chair—the chair I'd been sitting in earlier before I changed into pajamas. My regular jeans. The loose, practical ones I wear every day now. Not hidden. Not apologized for. Just... there.

He looked at them. Then at me. Then back at them.

I held my breath.

---

"Coffee shop going okay?" he asked.

Just like that. He saw the jeans. Acknowledged their existence by NOT acknowledging their existence. Chose grace instead of commentary.

"Yeah," I said. Voice shaky. "Yeah. It's going okay. Some days are better than others."

"That's how it goes." He took another sip of his terrible coffee. "Jack says you're doing good work. Says people are starting to come back regular."

"Jack said that?"

"He talks about you sometimes. At work." Dad looked down at his mug. "He's proud of you. Becky too."

*And you?* I didn't ask. Couldn't ask. Too afraid of any answer.

"I should get back," Dad said. Stood up. Brushed cinnamon roll crumbs off his jeans—because David Champion wears jeans too, always has, no theological crisis required.[^3]

I walked him to the door.

He stopped. Turned around. And then—

He hugged me.

Not the side-hug thing we'd been doing for years. A real hug. The kind where you actually hold on. The kind that says things words can't reach.

"I'm proud of who you're becoming," he whispered into my hair. "Even if I don't understand all of it."

Then he pulled back. Looked at me straight on. Dad's eyes are the same green as mine.

"Even if I don't understand all of it," he said again. "I'm proud."

---

I stood at my apartment door after Dad left, holding my grandmother's necklace with one hand, smelling cinnamon and bad coffee, and I thought about all the Christmas mornings before this one.

The ones where I woke up in my childhood bedroom and put on a long skirt and went downstairs to open presents according to Dad's schedule (7:30 AM sharp, no earlier). The ones where everything was orchestrated and nothing was spontaneous and I smiled and said thank you and felt small.

This wasn't that.

This was my father driving to my apartment on Christmas morning. Bringing terrible coffee because he tried. Bringing Linda's cinnamon rolls because she couldn't come herself but she could send love through layers of cinnamon and sugar. Bringing my grandmother's necklace because Linda wanted me to have it, wanted me to know I'm still theirs even though I'm also mine now.

This was Dad seeing my jeans and choosing not to make it a moment.

This was him saying *I'm proud* even though the sentence had to include *I don't understand.*

This wasn't the reconciliation I'd dreamed about. There would still be hard conversations ahead. Probably years of them. Probably moments where we hurt each other trying to bridge a gap that's both wider and narrower than we think.

But he came.

On Christmas morning, my father came.

---

I made myself good coffee. Real coffee. The kind I know how to make. Sat back in Linda's chair wrapped in the blanket Linda had sent with the chair (she knows I'm always cold), wearing the cross that Grandma wore, in my apartment above my coffee shop, in my building owned by people who believed in me.

I texted Jennifer: "Merry Christmas. I think I'm going to be okay."

She responded in 3.2 seconds: "You already are. ❤️ Coming over at noon with pie. DON'T ARGUE."

I wasn't going to argue. Jennifer shows up. That's what Jennifer does. And Dad showed up this morning. And Linda sent the necklace even though she can't say the words yet.

And I'm sitting here in my pajamas on Christmas morning, drinking perfect coffee in an imperfect life, holding my grandmother's cross and realizing:

Sometimes the greatest gifts don't come wrapped in perfection.

Sometimes they come wrapped in effort.

Sometimes they come in a thermos of terrible coffee and a container of cinnamon rolls and a father's quiet courage.

Sometimes they come in small steps toward each other, when giant leaps aren't possible yet.

Sometimes they whisper *I'm trying* instead of *I understand.*

And maybe—maybe—that's enough for today.

Maybe that's exactly what Christmas morning should be.

[^1]: Romans 8:1 has become my theological security blanket. I'm aware this is possibly not what Paul had in mind, but I'm also fairly certain Paul would understand anxiety spirals.

[^2]: Dad's coffee method involves measuring grounds by sight, boiling water in a kettle until it screams, and believing that "stronger is better" applies to both faith and coffee. Only one of these is correct.

[^3]: This is actually a profound theological point that I'm absolutely going to think too much about later: Dad's worn jeans his entire life without crisis because nobody told him he couldn't. The rules that bound me never bound him. That's worth examining. Possibly over more coffee. Definitely over more coffee.
