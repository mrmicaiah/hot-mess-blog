I woke up at 5 AM because anxiety doesn't believe in sleeping in.

The numbers were doing their thing again—the thing where they line up in my head like soldiers, merciless and precise. Rent: $875, due in three days. Betsy's gasket replacement: $180. That weird grinding noise the refrigerator started making: probably $200 if I'm lucky, probably $600 if I'm me. The register drawer that sticks: $150 for a replacement because of course you can't just buy the drawer, you have to buy the whole system.¹

I lay there in the dark, in my apartment above the shop that smells like coffee and hope and terror, and I did the math. Then I did it again. Then I did it seventeen more times because maybe if I calculated it differently, the numbers would change.

They didn't change.

I had $340 in my checking account and a week's worth of coffee beans. The shop was doing okay—not great, but okay. People were coming. Some were even becoming regulars. But "okay" doesn't pay rent when your margins are catastrophically thin and you're too stubborn to raise prices because you remember what it's like to count pennies.

I grabbed my phone. 5:47 AM. Too early to text Jennifer. Too early to call Dad (who would help, who would slip me cash, who would look at me with that mixture of pride and worry that makes me want to simultaneously hug him and prove I don't need saving).

So I prayed.

Not the pretty prayers I grew up with—the ones that sounded like we were trying to impress God with our vocabulary. Not the groveling ones I'd been taught, approaching the throne like a criminal instead of a daughter.

Just honest.

Desperate.

Sitting on my mattress in yesterday's clothes (I fell asleep stress-researching coffee suppliers), I said it out loud into the dark:

"God, I need help. Any help. Please. I don't know what to do and I'm scared and I really, really don't want to fail. I don't want to go home. I don't want to prove Mom right. I just—I need help. Please."

Romans 8:1 count for the morning: zero. I was too tired to fight condemnation. I just needed God to show up.

I showered because hygiene is important even during financial crises. Put on jeans (still a choice I make consciously, still a small rebellion, still mine). Made coffee in my apartment kitchen at 6:15 because what else do you do when you own a coffee shop and your life is falling apart?

The walk downstairs to The Hot Mess is exactly thirty-two steps when I'm not carrying anything and three years when I'm carrying the weight of impending failure.

This morning it was three years.

I came down the interior staircase, keys already in my hand, practicing the breathing technique Jennifer taught me (in for four, hold for seven, out for eight, try not to hyperventilate in the middle).

There was an envelope taped to the shop's front door.

Just—an envelope. White. Regular sized. My name written on the front in handwriting I didn't recognize: *Rena LeeAnn.*

Not Rena Champion. Rena LeeAnn.

My hands shook unlocking the door. I peeled the envelope off carefully (it was taped with that blue painter's tape that doesn't leave residue, which felt weirdly considerate). Went inside. Turned on the lights. Set my coffee mug down on the counter.

Stood there holding an envelope that probably contained someone's complaint about their latte or a request for catering I couldn't handle or—

I opened it.

Cash.

A lot of cash.

I counted it twice because my brain wasn't working. Five one-hundred-dollar bills. Ten twenties. Four tens. Five ones. A single piece of notebook paper folded in half.

$545.

I unfolded the note with hands that had completely forgotten how to be steady:

*For the girl who makes the best coffee and never charges enough. You helped me more than you know. —A customer*

That's it. No name. No signature beyond "A customer." No explanation.

I sat down on the floor.

Just—sat. Right there on the tile I'd mopped last night (badly, because I was tired and stressed and probably missed several spots). Legs crossed. Cash in one hand, note in the other. Still wearing my coat because I'd forgotten to take it off.

And I cried.

Not pretty crying. Not the kind where a single tear rolls cinematically down your cheek. The ugly kind. The kind where you can't breathe and your nose runs and you're making sounds that would be embarrassing if anyone could hear them.

$545.

Rent plus Betsy's gasket plus fifty dollars left over for the grinding noise.

Exactly what I needed. Not a penny more. Not a penny less.

*You helped me more than you know.*

But I didn't KNOW. That was the thing. I didn't know which customer. Didn't know what I'd done. Didn't know how they knew I needed this (except my prices are catastrophically low and maybe everyone can see I'm drowning except me).

I couldn't say thank you.

Couldn't return it if it was too much.

Couldn't even thank them with a free coffee because I had NO IDEA WHO THEY WERE.

I counted the money again. Still $545. Still real. Still impossible.

My mother's voice (because it's always there, isn't it?): *Don't accept gifts from strangers. There are always strings attached. Nothing is free.*

My new voice (still learning, still practicing): *Or maybe kindness is just kindness.*

My theological-wrestling voice (the one that won't shut up): *But is it coincidence or providence? Random chance or answered prayer? How do you know?*

I looked at the cash. At the note. At my phone where I'd prayed into the darkness three hours ago.

*God, I need help. Any help. Please.*

Any help.

And here it was. In an envelope. Taped to my door. From someone I'd never get to thank.

I thought about Jennifer's pastor—Jack Coleman, who owns this building with his wife Becky, who gave me a chance when nobody else would. He says God works through people. That sometimes the answer to prayer doesn't look like a miracle, it looks like someone's Tuesday afternoon decision to be kind.

I thought about the woman who comes in every Thursday, orders a cortado, sits in the corner and works on her laptop. How I always put a little extra foam on top because she seems tired. How I never charge her for refills because she tips well and tips are just recycled money anyway.

I thought about the guy who comes in before work, always harried, always stressed. How I started having his Americano ready when I saw him walking up because he's always running late. How he once told me this place was the only good part of his morning.

I thought about the college student who sits here for hours studying, nursing a single coffee. How I've never asked her to leave even when I'm busy, because I remember being young and broke and desperate for somewhere safe to exist.

I thought about every single person I've served coffee to in the last seven months. Every conversation. Every smile. Every "how are you?" that I meant sinfully.²

*You helped me more than you know.*

Maybe I did.

Maybe showing up counts as helping. Maybe making good coffee counts. Maybe creating a space where people feel safe counts. Maybe all of it counts and I'm just too busy panicking to notice.

Or maybe—and this is the thought that made me cry harder—maybe it's not about me at all.

Maybe someone prayed for me and didn't know it.

Maybe God is just God and sometimes He answers prayers with cash in envelopes and anonymous notes and timing so perfect it makes you believe in providence instead of coincidence.

I chose providence.

I chose to believe.

I sat on that floor for probably twenty minutes, crying and counting money and reading the note over and over like it might change or disappear or turn out to be a dream.

Then I texted Jennifer: *God is real and He knows my rent is due.*

She responded immediately (because Jennifer doesn't sleep apparently): *WHAT HAPPENED*

Me: *Tell you later. Bringing you the best coffee I've ever made.*

Because I could now. Because I had rent money. Because someone—I'll never know who—decided to be the hands and feet of Christ on a Tuesday morning when I was drowning.

I made coffee with shaking hands.

Put the cash in the register drawer (the one that sticks) and locked it. Folded the note carefully and put it in my pocket. Opened the shop at exactly 7 AM because routine is important when your entire world just shifted.

The first customer was the college student. She ordered her regular coffee. I made it perfect. Didn't charge her for the extra shot I added. She looked exhausted. Maybe she needed someone to be kind to her, too.

That night, back upstairs in my apartment, I taped the anonymous note to my bathroom mirror. Right next to the $5 bill from the homeless man who bought coffee two weeks ago and told me I was going to make it.³

My wall of "God showed up here."

Physical evidence for when doubt whispers louder than faith.

I stood there in my jeans, in my apartment above a coffee shop that smells like hope, looking at the note:

*You helped me more than you know.*

And I thought: *You too, stranger. You too.*

Romans 8:1 count for the day: zero.

I didn't need it.

I had $545 and an answered prayer instead.

¹ Capitalism is exhausting and also I've researched this extensively at 2 AM while eating cereal directly from the box.

² I learned that word from reading too much and having nobody to talk to for most of my life. It means genuinely. I use it wrong probably.

³ He came in looking embarrassed, said he didn't have much, counted out exactly $5 in quarters and dimes. I made him the best coffee I've ever made and gave him three of Jennifer's homemade cookies. He said, "You're gonna make it, kid." Then he left. I cried. This is a pattern with me apparently.
