I almost didn't go.

I was sitting in my car outside Todd's parents' house at 6:47 PM on Christmas Eve, engine running, hands on the steering wheel, having a full existential crisis about green bean casserole and the nature of belonging.

Todd had invited me three weeks ago. "My family does this whole chaotic Christmas Eve thing," he'd said, fixing Betsy's steam wand. "Mom always makes too much food. My nephew will probably ask you forty-seven questions about coffee. Fair warning: someone will burn the green bean casserole. They burn it every year. It's tradition at this point."

I could leave. I could text Todd right now—"So sorry, emergency at the shop"—and drive home to my apartment and eat pizza alone.

That sounded safe.

That sounded lonely.

I turned off the engine.

The front door opened before I even reached the porch.

"RENA!"

Todd's nephew—I'd met him exactly once—launched himself at me like an enthusiastic guided missile. I caught him mostly by accident, stumbling backward, nearly dropping the pie I'd brought.[^1]

"You came! Do you remember me? I'm Mason! You gave me hot chocolate!"

Todd appeared in the doorway. "Let her breathe, Mason. That's generally considered polite."

And just like that, I was inside.

Todd's mother descended on me immediately.

"You must be Rena! I'm Susan. Todd's told us so much about you. Can you chop vegetables? I'm drowning in vegetables."

She handed me an apron—red, covered in flour handprints—and positioned me at the counter next to a mountain of carrots.

"Just rough chop. Todd says you make excellent coffee. Can you teach him? His coffee is terrible."

"Mom." Todd appeared. "You're doing the thing where you talk at hurricane speed."

"I'm being welcoming!"

And here's the thing: I felt welcome.

Not because the house felt familiar—my Christmases growing up were silent, controlled, everyone on best behavior. This was chaos. Todd's dad was arguing about football. Mason was showing cousins a loud video. Someone was burning the green bean casserole, right on schedule.

But Susan handed me a peeler. Todd's sister brought me wine without asking. Jerry made a terrible joke about carrots that was so bad I laughed.

They treated me like I belonged there.

Like there was a Rena-shaped space in their kitchen that had just been waiting to be filled.

Dinner was chaos orchestrated by people who'd been doing chaos together for decades.

Seven adults, four kids, plates that didn't match, a turkey that was "only slightly dry this year," and the green bean casserole, burned to a crisp, served anyway.

"It's performance art at this point," Todd's sister explained. "We could make it successfully. We choose not to."

"Why?"

"Because Christmas isn't about perfection. It's about showing up even when you burn things."

I'd spent my entire childhood being taught that Christmas was about perfection. Perfect behavior. Perfect silence during perfect prayers.

This was Mason spilling his milk and Jerry immediately spilling his own "in solidarity." This was Todd's aunt Pat telling an inappropriate story that made Susan cry-laugh. This was people being fully, messily themselves.

It felt more holy than any silent Christmas I'd ever known.

At 11:45 PM, Jerry stood up.

"You know what time it is."

Someone turned off the lights. Susan distributed candles. We gathered in the living room.

"Luke, chapter 2. And it came to pass in those days..."

I'd heard this story a thousand times. But hearing Jerry read it, surrounded by his chaotic, messy, beautiful family—

"...and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."

I started crying.

Because there was no room at the inn. Because I knew exactly how that felt—showing up and not fitting, standing outside wondering if you'd misunderstood the invitation.

And then God said: I'll come into the mess, into the places that aren't clean or proper.

I'll meet you where you are.

Susan squeezed my hand. "There's always room here."

---

It was 12:30 AM.

I was on the couch holding the worst coffee I'd ever tasted. It was instant. Made with lukewarm water. Possibly with grounds in it.

Mason had fallen asleep on my lap somewhere around midnight. Just... there. Trusting me completely.

My phone buzzed. Text from Dad: "Merry Christmas."

I typed back: "Merry Christmas, Rena LeeAnn."

He responded: "Proud of you. Always."

I looked around the room.

The Christmas story is about God making space for humanity in the mess of a barn.

Sometimes humans make space for each other the same way.

Not because everything's perfect.

Because showing up is enough.

[^1]: The pie survived. Susan said it was "the best store-bought pie she'd ever had." I didn't correct her.
