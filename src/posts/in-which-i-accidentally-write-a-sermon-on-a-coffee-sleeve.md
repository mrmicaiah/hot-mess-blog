It started, like most things in my life, with me not knowing what I was doing.

I'd been writing little notes on coffee sleeves for months by the time this happened. Nothing profound—"Happy Tuesday!" or "You've got this!" or, once, "Your hair looks amazing" to a woman who looked like she needed to hear it. She cried. I cried. We were both standing in puddles of espresso because I'd gotten distracted mid-pour. It was a moment.

The sleeve thing wasn't planned. It started because I'd ordered the wrong sleeves—bulk, plain brown, no logo—and I was too broke to replace them, so I figured I'd at least make them interesting. Plus, I have this compulsive need to fill blank spaces with words, probably because I grew up in a house where too many words were wrong but not enough words were also wrong, and I never figured out the right amount, so now I just spray words at everything like a fire extinguisher and hope for the best.

Anyway. The sleeves.

Most days, people barely noticed. They'd grab their drink, glance at the sleeve, maybe smile, walk out. I'd watch them go and think: *That's fine. That's enough. You put a tiny bit of kindness into the world and it doesn't have to matter. It can just exist.*

But this one Tuesday—this gray, wet, nothing-special Tuesday in early November—a man walked into The Hot Mess looking like he'd lost something he couldn't name.

---

I'm not good at reading people. I know this about myself. I once asked Jennifer if she was okay because she "looked sad" and she said she was literally just squinting because she'd lost her contacts. So I try not to make assumptions. But this man—mid-forties, maybe, with the kind of tired that lives in your bones—he wasn't squinting.

He stood at the counter for a full minute before ordering. I know because I counted. I was reorganizing the sugar packets by color (anxiety makes you do weird things) and I'd gotten to "light brown, thirty-seven, thirty-eight—" when he finally spoke.

"Just coffee. Black."

That's it. No "please," but not rude. Just... empty. Like the word was all he had.

I poured the coffee. My hands did the thing they always do—steady with the pot, precise with the pour—and then I reached for a sleeve and my marker and I wrote "Have a good day!" and then—

I stopped.

Something in his face. I don't know. The way he was staring at the counter like it might give him answers. The way his shoulders curved in like he was trying to take up less space. I recognized it. Not the specifics, but the shape of it. The posture of someone who's been told, over and over, that they're not enough. That they're wrong. That they don't belong.

I grew up with that posture.

So instead of "Have a good day!"—which suddenly felt like handing someone a band-aid for a broken leg—I turned the sleeve over and wrote something else.

---

Here's the thing about Romans 8:1: it's the verse that saved my life.

Not literally. Or maybe literally? I don't know where the line is anymore between metaphor and actual intervention. But I remember being nineteen, sitting in my childhood bedroom surrounded by Bible concordances and highlighters and guilt so thick I could barely breathe, trying to figure out why I felt condemned all the time when Jesus was supposed to be about grace.

And there it was: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."

Now. Present tense. Not "eventually, after you've earned it." Not "once you stop messing up." Not "when your mother finally approves of your life choices."

Now.

I'd read that verse a hundred times before. Probably memorized it for some church program when I was twelve. But I'd never actually *heard* it. I'd been taught that grace was conditional—that Jesus loved me, sure, but also I'd better not wear pants or listen to music with drums or think too hard about whether the rules made sense, because then I'd be rebellious and rebellious people didn't get grace.

But the verse didn't say that. The verse said *now*. The verse said *no condemnation*. The verse said: you're free.

So that's what I wrote on the sleeve. Not the whole verse—there wasn't room—but enough. I wrote: *No condemnation. Not earned. Already yours. Romans 8:1.*

And then, because I am who I am, I wrote underneath it: *Also you're not alone. Whatever it is.*

I don't know why I added that part. It just came out. Like my hand knew something my brain hadn't caught up to yet.

The man took his coffee. Looked at the sleeve. Looked at me—this quick, startled thing, like I'd seen him when he didn't want to be seen. Then he walked out.

I immediately forgot about it. Not because it wasn't important, but because Mrs. Garcia came in wanting her usual oat milk latte, and I got distracted explaining the chemistry of oat milk steaming versus dairy and by the time I looked up again, the man was gone, and so was the sleeve, and I moved on because that's what you do. You put kindness into the world and you don't track it. You can't. It would drive you crazy.

A week passed. Maybe eight days. I'd written probably forty more sleeves by then—"You're doing great!" and "Wednesday is almost Thursday!" and "Your eyebrows are phenomenal" (that one was for Mia, who does actually have phenomenal eyebrows).

And then he came back.

---

I almost didn't recognize him.

Not because he looked different—he did, a little, something around the eyes that was less hollow—but because my brain doesn't hold faces the way it holds coffee roasting profiles or Scripture references. I'll forget what someone looks like five minutes after meeting them, but I can tell you the exact altitude and processing method of a Yirgacheffe bean. This is probably a personality flaw.

But when he walked up to the counter and put something down in front of me—something brown and rectangular and covered in shiny plastic—I remembered.

The coffee sleeve. My handwriting. *No condemnation. Not earned. Already yours.*

He'd laminated it.

"I need you to know something," he said.

My hands were already shaking. I didn't know why yet, but my body knew. My body always knows things before my brain catches up. Usually this means I've knocked something over. This time it meant I gripped the counter so hard my knuckles went white.

"I was going to do something permanent last week," he said. "That night. After I left here."

The shop went very quiet. Or maybe it was already quiet—Tuesday afternoons are slow—but it felt like the kind of quiet that happens when the world holds its breath.

"I had it all planned out," he continued. His voice was steady, somehow. Steadier than mine would have been. "I'd been planning it for a while. And then I got in my car, and I had the coffee, and I read what you wrote, and—"

He stopped. Breathed.

"And I thought: what if she's right? What if I'm not as condemned as I feel? What if there's actually—" He gestured at the sleeve. "What if it's true?"

I couldn't speak. I wanted to say something—anything—but my throat had closed up and my eyes were doing that thing where they fill with water without permission, and I was standing in a small puddle (not espresso this time, just the tears I apparently couldn't control) thinking: *I almost wrote "Have a good day." I almost just wrote "Have a good day."*

"I went home," he said, "and I read the whole chapter. Romans 8. And then I called someone. And now I'm—" He shrugged, and there was something like hope in it. "Now I'm still here. And I wanted you to know."

He pushed the laminated sleeve toward me.

"I got it laminated because I'm going to keep it," he said. "I hope that's not weird. But I wanted you to see it. I wanted you to know it mattered."

His name was Daniel.

I know because I asked. After I'd stopped crying enough to speak, after he'd bought coffee and sat down, after I'd closed the shop early—just flipped the sign to "CLOSED" and let the espresso machine finish its hissing and sat across from him at one of the mismatched tables—I asked his name.

"Daniel," he said.

"I'm Rena LeeAnn," I said, because I always say both names now, because they're both mine.

We didn't talk for long. I didn't ask what happened that made him get to that point—that's his story, not mine—and he didn't ask why I'd written what I wrote. We just sat with the weight of it. The impossible, random, terrifying weight of what almost happened and what didn't.

Before he left, he said: "You should keep doing the sleeve thing."

"I don't always write deep stuff," I admitted. "Sometimes it's just, like, 'Happy Wednesday' or whatever."

He smiled. First time I'd seen it. "That might be enough too. You don't know where it's landing."

---

After he left, I sat in my empty shop for a very long time.

The late afternoon light came through the windows and made everything golden and dusty and too bright. I was holding the laminated sleeve—he'd left it with me after all, said he'd written the verse down somewhere he could keep it forever—and my hands wouldn't stop shaking.

I kept looking at my own handwriting. It looked so ordinary. A little messy, slanting slightly upward the way it always does when I'm writing fast. The ink had smudged a little on the word "condemnation." Just a normal coffee sleeve with normal handwriting and abnormal weight.

I thought about all the things I'd learned growing up about how to share God. Door-to-door evangelism. Rehearsed scripts. The "Roman Road" we memorized for witnessing to strangers. There were formulas for it. Techniques. Diagrams showing how to lead someone through the Steps of Salvation like you were assembling IKEA furniture.

Nobody ever mentioned coffee sleeves.

Nobody ever said: "Maybe just write something true when you feel like it. Maybe don't overthink it. Maybe your job isn't to convert people—maybe it's just to remind them they're not condemned."

But here's what I'm learning: God works in the margins. In the literally marginal—the edges of coffee sleeves, the spaces we think don't count. In the quick impulse to write something real instead of something safe. In the moments we almost don't follow.

I almost didn't write it.

I almost just wrote "Have a good day."

But something—some impulse, some nudge, some thing I don't have a word for—made me flip the sleeve over and write more. Write the verse that saved my own life once, in a different context, in a childhood bedroom full of highlighters and guilt.

I gave it away on a coffee sleeve and it caught someone falling.

I called Jennifer. Could barely speak.

"I think," I said, and my voice was doing that weird watery thing, "I think I accidentally saved someone's life with a coffee sleeve."

There was a pause. I could hear her breathing. Then:

"That's not accidental," she said. "That's exactly what you're supposed to be doing."

"I didn't even know it mattered," I said. "I forgot about it immediately. I wrote forty other sleeves after that. I had no idea—"

"You're not supposed to know." Her voice was gentle. Jennifer's voice is always gentle when it matters, even when she's confidently wrong about everything else. "That's the whole point. You throw it into the world and you don't get to see where it lands. But you have to keep throwing."

"What if I'd written something different? What if I'd just put 'Have a good day'?"

"But you didn't," she said. "You wrote what you wrote."

"But I almost—"

"Rena." Her voice had that firm kindness she gets when she's about to say something I need to hear but don't want to. "You almost a lot of things. We all almost a lot of things. But almost doesn't count. What counts is what you actually did. And what you actually did was write a verse on a coffee sleeve that kept someone alive."

I was crying by then. Obviously. I'm me. I cry at coffee and text messages from my dad and commercials about dogs. Of course I cried about this. I cried so hard I had to sit down on the floor behind the counter, wedged between the refrigerated case and a stack of to-go cups, which probably isn't dignified but dignity has never been my strong suit anyway.

"What am I supposed to do now?" I asked. "Like, how do I—what do I do with this?"

"You keep making coffee," Jennifer said. "You keep writing on sleeves. You keep doing exactly what you've been doing."

"That's it?"

"That's not *it*, Rena. That's everything. That's the whole thing. You found what you're supposed to be doing and you're already doing it. Most people never figure that out."

I cried harder. But it was a different kind of crying. Not the anxious, 3 AM, what-if-I-fail crying. This was something else. Something that felt like awe.

---

I didn't sleep that night.

Not in the anxious, spiraling way I usually don't sleep—not the 3 AM "what if I fail and have to move home and wear jean skirts forever" kind of awake. This was different. This was lying in bed staring at my ceiling, watching the streetlight make patterns through my curtains, thinking about coffee sleeves and timing and all the tiny moments that could have gone another way.

What if I'd been busy when Daniel came in? What if Mrs. Garcia had arrived five minutes earlier and I'd been elbow-deep in oat milk foam and just handed him the coffee without writing anything? What if I'd been in one of my moods where everything feels hopeless and I couldn't think of anything encouraging to write, so I just left the sleeve blank?

What if I'd written "Have a good day" like I almost did?

The what-ifs can drive you crazy if you let them. I know this because I have an advanced degree in what-iffing. I what-if everything: What if I'd never gone to that potluck at Jennifer's church? What if I'd never seen those women in jeans, loving God, being free? What if I'd stayed in my parents' house forever, wearing long skirts, following rules that weren't even in the Bible, believing I was too broken for grace?

But here's the thing about what-ifs: they go both directions.

What if every tiny choice we make is rippling outward in ways we can't see? What if the woman I told had amazing hair actually needed to hear it that day? What if the "Happy Wednesday" I wrote for a teenager last month was the first kind thing anyone said to her all week? What if there are a hundred Daniels out there who I'll never know about, who caught something I threw into the world and used it to hold on for one more day?

That thought kept me awake until 4 AM. Not in a bad way. In an awe way. In a terrifying, beautiful, too-big-for-my-brain way.

---

Here's what I've been thinking about since.

I've been thinking about all the words I've thrown into the world. All the sleeve notes and the "have a good day"s and the times I've info-dumped about coffee beans at people who didn't ask. All the anxious rambling and the over-explaining and the jokes that don't quite land.

I've been thinking about how words are these tiny things we fling into the universe without knowing their trajectory. Without knowing who catches them. Without knowing if they matter at all or if they're the one thing standing between someone and the permanent dark.

That's terrifying.

But here's the other thing: it's also the whole point.

Because if my words can catch someone—without me planning it, without me even knowing—then maybe that's what we're all supposed to be doing. Throwing words. Throwing kindness. Throwing the verses that saved us and the encouragement we needed and the "you're not alone"s that might seem like nothing but might be everything.

We don't get to see where they land. Most of the time we won't know. Most of the time we'll forget we even said them.

But some of them are landing exactly where they need to.

Some of them are catching people we'll never know about.

Some of them—some of them are keeping people here.

I made myself a coffee after Jennifer hung up. Double shot, oat milk, a little cinnamon because I felt like I needed comfort. Then I got a blank sleeve—one of the plain brown ones I'd been writing on all these months—and I wrote on it:

*You're doing better than you think.*

I took it upstairs to my apartment. Stuck it on my bathroom mirror with a piece of tape that immediately fell off because I'd used the wrong kind. Stuck it up again with better tape.

Now every morning I see it. My own handwriting. My own words. A reminder to keep throwing.

I don't know if this story has a neat ending. Real life doesn't really do those. Daniel still comes in sometimes—not every week, but often enough that I know his order now (black coffee, no sleeve necessary, he brings his own reusable cup decorated with hiking stickers). He seems better. Whatever better means. He's still here.

I'm still here too.

I wrote a sermon on a coffee sleeve and I didn't know I was doing it. I was just a woman with a marker and too many feelings and a verse that once kept me breathing.

That's all any of us have, really. A few words. A blank space. The hope that something we say might matter to someone we'll never know.

So I'm going to keep writing on the sleeves. Keep putting the kindness out there. Keep throwing words into the world even when I have no idea where they'll land.

Because some of them—some of them are landing exactly where they need to be.

And that's not accidental.

That's the whole point.

**Now:**

If you're reading this and you're in a dark place—if you're making plans you shouldn't be making—please know: you're not condemned. Not because you earned un-condemnation. Not because you've been good enough. Just because grace is bigger than whatever voice is telling you you're not enough.

Romans 8:1. Present tense. No conditions.

And also: you're not alone. Whatever it is.

I mean it. Even if we've never met. Even if you're reading this on a screen somewhere I'll never see.

You're not alone.
