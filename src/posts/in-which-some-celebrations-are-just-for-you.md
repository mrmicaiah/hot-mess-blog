I find the adoption paperwork while looking for my W-2.

This is not how I intended to spend my Sunday morning. I intended to spend my Sunday morning drinking coffee and ignoring my responsibilities like a normal adult, but then I remembered that taxes exist and I'm now a business owner who has to do business owner things, and so here I am, sitting on my apartment floor surrounded by receipts I definitely should have organized months ago.[^1]

The paperwork is in a folder labeled "IMPORTANT — DO NOT LOSE," which is optimistic given that I'd completely forgotten it existed. I pull it out, and there's Mabel's adoption certificate from the county shelter, dated exactly six months ago today.

Six months.

I look up. Mabel is in the cozy chair — Linda's chair, my chair, but really Mabel's chair now — curled into a perfect gray circle, nose tucked under tail, completely unconscious. She's snoring slightly. It's the most undignified sound, a tiny wheeze-whistle that no self-respecting cat would ever admit to making.

Six months ago today, she wouldn't come out from under my bed.

I didn't plan to get a cat. The apartment felt too quiet, that was all. I'd been here for three months, and every night the silence pressed in like something physical, and I'd lie in bed listening to nothing and wondering if this was what freedom actually felt like — just empty space where the noise used to be.

Jennifer said I needed a plant. "Something to take care of! Something alive!"

I killed the plant in two weeks. Overwatered. Apparently love can drown things.

Then I walked past the shelter on a Tuesday — I don't even remember why I was on that street — and there was a cat in the window. Gray. Green eyes. Pressed into the back corner of her cage like she was trying to disappear into the wall.

The volunteer said she'd been there for four months. "She's not very friendly," she warned. "Shy. Probably needs someone patient."

I looked at the cat. The cat looked at me. Two creatures who had no idea what they were doing, both trying to disappear, both failing.

"I'll take her," I said.

The first three days, I only knew she was alive because the food disappeared.

She stayed under the bed. I'd lie on my stomach and peer into the darkness and see two green eyes staring back, and I'd talk to her — about the shop, about Jennifer, about how I also didn't know how to exist in this space yet — and she'd watch me like I was something dangerous that might explode at any moment.

I named her Mabel because it felt old-fashioned and dignified, and also because when I said "How about Mabel?" she sneezed, which I chose to interpret as agreement.

Day four, she came out at 3 AM. I know because I woke up to the sound of her knocking my water glass off the nightstand. Shattered everywhere. I sat up in a panic, and there she was, frozen in the middle of the floor, looking at me with an expression that said *I have made a terrible mistake and I blame you for it.*

"It's okay," I told her. "I break things too."

She ran back under the bed. But the next night, she came out again.

The milestones were small. So small that anyone else would have missed them.

The first time she let me touch her — just one finger, just for a second, before she flinched away. The first time she sat on the bed while I was in it, three feet of distance maintained, watching me like she was conducting a scientific study. The first time she fell asleep in the same room as me, her breathing evening out while I held perfectly still, terrified that any movement would break whatever fragile spell had been cast.

The first slow blink.

If you don't know cats, you don't know what that means. But a slow blink is trust. It's a cat saying *I feel safe enough to close my eyes around you.* It's the closest thing to "I love you" that a creature with no words can offer.

She slow-blinked at me on a Thursday in April. I cried. She looked alarmed. I tried to explain that these were happy tears, but she's a cat, so she just walked away with her tail up, which I've learned is actually a good sign.

Then came the chair.

Linda's chair. The chair that arrived without explanation, without a note, without any acknowledgment that my mother had sent it. The chair I've sat in every night since I moved here, reading or praying or just existing.

One evening I came upstairs and Mabel was in it. Not hiding behind it. Not perched on the arm. *In* it. Curled up in the exact center like she'd always belonged there.

I stood in the doorway for a full minute, afraid to breathe.

She looked at me. Slow-blinked. Went back to sleep.

Now I'm sitting on the floor of my apartment with adoption paperwork in my hands and receipts scattered around me, and Mabel is snoring in the chair, and the morning light is coming through the window that faces the church, and I think: *this is enough.*

Not enough like settling. Not enough like giving up on wanting more. Enough like — full. Complete. The kind of contentment that doesn't need anything added.

*I have learned to be content*, the verse says. *Learned* — like it's a skill, like it takes practice, like you don't just wake up one day grateful for your small life in your small apartment with your small snoring cat. You learn it. Day by day. Slow blink by slow blink.

I get up — carefully, because my foot is asleep and the receipts are a hazard — and I make myself a cup of coffee. Just drip. Nothing fancy. I bring it back to the living room and sit on the floor next to the chair, my back against the cushion, close enough that I can hear Mabel's ridiculous little snore-whistles.

Six months ago, she hid under the bed.

Now she's here. Now I'm here. Two creatures who didn't know how to exist in this space, figuring it out together.

I raise my coffee cup in her direction. "Happy anniversary, Mabel."

She doesn't wake up. She doesn't need to.

Some celebrations are just for you.
