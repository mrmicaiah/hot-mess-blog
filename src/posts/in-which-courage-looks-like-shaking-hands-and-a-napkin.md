She comes in at 2:15 on a Tuesday, and I know something's wrong before she reaches the counter—it's the way she holds herself, shoulders curved inward like she's trying to take up less space than she already does, arms crossed over her chest in that protective way I remember from mirrors I tried not to look into. She's maybe sixteen, seventeen, old enough to be in a coffee shop alone but young enough that it feels strange she is, and her dress is long and floral and high-necked in a way that makes my stomach clench.

I know that dress. I owned seven versions of it.

"Small drip coffee," she says, not meeting my eyes. "Please."

She's already counting coins from a small purse—quarters, dimes, nickels, the exact amount down to the penny like she calculated it before she came. I pour the coffee and she takes it to the corner table, the one with the cemetery view, and sits with her back to the wall facing the door.

Then she waits.

The first hour, I tell myself it's nothing—people wait for people, that's what coffee shops are for. But she doesn't pull out a phone, doesn't open a book. She just sits there with her hands wrapped around the cup, watching the door every time the bell rings, and when it's not whoever she's waiting for, something in her face does this thing—hope collapsing into patience, patience hardening into endurance—that makes me want to sit down next to her and say I know, I know, I know.

I refill her coffee without asking instead. She startles when I approach, which tells me something, and says "I didn't—" and I say "On the house" and she says "I can't—" and I say "It's just coffee, refills are free anyway," which is a lie, but the quarters in her purse looked like everything she had.[^1]

She wraps her hands around the fresh cup. Doesn't say thank you, but her shoulders drop half an inch. I take it.

The second hour, I clean things that are already clean just to stay where I can watch the corner table without obviously watching. She checks a small flip phone once more—no notifications—and puts it away with the same careful blankness I recognize from years of practicing not reacting to disappointment.

At 4:00, Noah comes in for his Ethiopian blend. I make it without speaking—we don't need words anymore—and he takes his usual seat. He glances at the girl, then at me, raises an eyebrow. I shrug. But when he settles into his chair, I notice he angles himself between her table and the door. Not blocking. Just present.

Something loosens in my chest.

At 4:30, she stands up.

Her coffee's been empty for twenty minutes but she carries the cup to the counter anyway, sets it down gently, says "Thank you" still without meeting my eyes, and turns toward the door. And I think about all the things I didn't say when I was her age, sitting in church pews with my shoulders curved inward, waiting for permission that wasn't coming. I think about Jennifer, who kept inviting me until I finally said yes. I think about how someone has to say it first.[^2]

"Hey."

She stops. Turns. Finally looks at me—really looks—and her eyes are red-rimmed and exhausted and so young.

I grab a napkin. My hand is shaking, which means my handwriting will be terrible, but I write it anyway and slide it across the counter because I don't trust my voice.

You're allowed to leave.

She stares at it. Nothing moves—not her, not me, not the dust in the afternoon light. Then she folds the napkin once, twice, tucks it into her purse with the coins.

"I don't know how," she says. Almost a whisper.

"Me neither." I have to swallow. "But I did it anyway. And—" I gesture around at the shop, at the mismatched tables and the book exchange shelf and the bulletin board with Romans 8:1 pinned in the center and Noah pretending not to listen. "It's messy. But it's mine."

She looks around, really taking it in, and something in her face shifts—not hope, not yet, but the first loosening of something that had been held tight.

"The Hot Mess," she reads from the window. Almost smiles. "Is that on purpose?"

"Unfortunately, yes."

This time she does smile. Small, but real.

"I have to go. My ride—"

"I know."

She hesitates at the door, looking back, and I think about seeds and soil and how you never know which ones take root, and she says "Thank you, for the coffee," and I say "It's—" and knock over the cup of pens by the register because this is who I am, and they scatter across the counter while the girl laughs—actually laughs—and I'm laughing too. "It's a good place to figure things out," I finish, and the bell rings, and she's gone.

Noah appears at the counter, sets down his empty cup.

"I don't know if it'll help," I say.

He taps the counter once. "You said it."

He leaves. The shop is quiet.

I stand there holding a pen, thinking about napkins and coins and girls who wait for permission that isn't coming—about how courage isn't the absence of shaking hands but writing something anyway, saying the thing you wish someone had said to you.

I don't know if she'll come back. I don't know if she'll unfold that napkin tonight or ten years from now. But I said it.

Outside, the October light is going golden. A car pulls away from the curb—her ride, taking her back to wherever she's not allowed to leave yet.

I make myself a cortado and sit at the counter and breathe.[^3]

[^1]: I didn't have my own money until I was twenty-six. The coins in that girl's purse looked like freedom scraped together in secret.

[^2]: Someone did, eventually. Jennifer. She didn't say "you're allowed to leave." She said "come to potluck on Sunday." But it meant the same thing.

[^3]: The cortado is perfect. There are still pens on the floor. This is the ratio of my life.
