I've made approximately 4,847 cups of coffee in my life.[^1]

I can tell you the precise water temperature for optimal extraction (203°F), the exact grind size for a pour-over (medium-fine, like sea salt), and the cupping notes of every single-origin bean at Riverside Coffee Roasting (Ethiopian Yirgacheffe: floral, citrus, jasmine; Guatemalan Antigua: chocolate, caramel, nutty; Sumatran Mandheling: earthy, herbal, full-bodied—do you want me to keep going? I can keep going).

But apparently I cannot label two airpots correctly.

This is how I accidentally caffeinated the church seniors and decaffeinated the youth group.

Let me back up.

Jennifer asked if I'd bring coffee to the Wednesday night potluck. "Just coffee," she said. "You don't have to make a dish or anything. Everyone knows you're busy with the shop."

Which was kind and also mortifying because "busy with the shop" actually means "Rena is currently having a small crisis about whether she ordered enough filters and also she found a suspicious stain on the ceiling and spent forty-five minutes googling 'ceiling stain coffee shop health code violation' at 2 AM."[^2]

But I said yes. Because Jennifer is my friend and because I'm GOOD at coffee, even if I'm not good at ceiling stains or sleeping at normal human hours or, as it turns out, basic labeling systems.

I planned everything. EVERYTHING. I had a color-coded system—blue tape for decaf, red tape for regular. I wrote out instructions to myself in increasingly large handwriting: "BLUE = DECAF. RED = REGULAR. DO NOT MIX THESE UP, RENA."

I made fresh coffee that morning. I used the good beans—the ones Todd helped me source from Riverside. I calculated ratios. I controlled for variables. I was a SCIENTIST of coffee preparation.

Then I loaded both airpots into my car.

And that's when I thought: "Wait, did I actually APPLY the tape? Or did I just plan to apply the tape?"

Narrator voice: She did not apply the tape.

---

By the time I arrived at church, I'd already convinced myself that I HAD applied the tape and had somehow misremembered the moment. This is what anxiety does—it makes you question your own lived experience. Also I'd been mentally rehearsing what to say if someone asked about The Hot Mess opening date (still unknown, panic ongoing) and had completely left my body.

I set up the coffee station in the fellowship hall. Two identical silver airpots. No labels. No color-coded tape. Just... two containers of coffee-colored liquid that looked exactly the same.

"Which one's decaf?" someone asked.

I stared at them. I stared at the airpots. They stared back at me with their identical silver faces, giving away nothing.

"This one," I said, pointing to the left one with the confidence of someone who has no idea what they're talking about but has learned that confidence is 90% of social interaction.

Was I right?

Reader, I was not.

Here's what I eventually pieced together:

The Wednesday schedule has two groups. From 5:30-6:30 PM, the seniors meet for Bible study in the chapel. From 6:30-7:30 PM, the youth group meets in the fellowship hall. Both groups filter through the coffee station at some point.

The seniors—lovely people in their seventies and eighties who normally move at a dignified pace and speak in gentle, measured tones—got the REGULAR coffee. Full octane. Enough caffeine to wake the dead or at least make them debate theological fine points with unprecedented vigor.

The youth group—teenagers and twenty-somethings who normally have the energy of caffeinated squirrels—got the DECAF. Basically warm brown water with delusions of grandeur.

I didn't realize any of this was happening.

I was in the kitchen helping Jennifer set out desserts (someone made a Jello salad and I have QUESTIONS about whether Jello should contain shredded carrots, but this is not the time). I could hear the general hum of conversation from the fellowship hall, but nothing seemed amiss.

Then Mrs. Williams walked by.

Mrs. Williams is eighty-three years old. She's tiny—maybe five feet tall if she's wearing shoes with good soles. She always sits in the third pew on the right. She always wears cardigans. She always brings butterscotch candies and offers them to anyone within reach.

Mrs. Williams is SWEET. She's the human embodiment of a gentle breeze and soft-baked cookies.

Mrs. Williams walked past the kitchen at approximately the speed of a power-walker, gesturing emphatically with both hands, mid-sentence: "—and ANOTHER thing about Ephesians 2:8-9, if salvation is by grace through FAITH and not of works, then why do we keep acting like our goodness is what saves us? It's theological inconsistency! It's—oh, hello dear."

She smiled at me, offered a butterscotch candy from her cardigan pocket, and kept walking.

I blinked.

Jennifer blinked.

"Did Mrs. Williams just..." Jennifer started.

"Use the phrase 'theological inconsistency'?" I finished.

We both looked at each other. Then we looked toward the fellowship hall.

That's when we heard it.

Voices. Lots of voices. ANIMATED voices. The seniors' Bible study sounded like... a debate team. A very enthusiastic, possibly over-caffeinated debate team.

"I'm just SAYING," someone declared (I think it was Mr. Patterson, who normally nods and says "that's nice dear" to everything), "that the church has been WRONG about this for YEARS and maybe it's time we ADMITTED it—"

Oh no.

Oh no no no.

---

I ran to the fellowship hall. Well, I ran two steps, then I tripped over my own feet (classic), caught myself on a chair (narrowly avoided disaster), and then speed-walked very urgently the rest of the way.

The seniors were ALIVE.

Like, DEEPLY alive. There were at least four separate conversations happening simultaneously. Mrs. Chen was standing—STANDING—and pointing to a Bible passage while two other ladies leaned in and nodded vigorously. Mr. Patterson was pacing. PACING. I'd never seen him do anything faster than a dignified stroll.

And in the corner, sweet Mrs. Rodriguez—who normally speaks so softly you have to lean in to hear her—was making a passionate case about grace versus works, and three people were actually listening with the intensity of people watching a thriller movie.

It was beautiful.

It was also definitely the caffeine.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, the youth group had gathered. They were supposed to be doing some kind of game night. Instead, approximately half of them were slumped in chairs looking drowsy. The youth pastor, Brandon (mid-thirties, normally enthusiastic to the point of exhaustion), was actually ASLEEP in a folding chair, mouth slightly open.

One of the teenagers was taking a selfie with him.

Another was writing "SEND HELP" on a piece of paper and holding it up behind his head for the photo.

This was bad.

This was very, very bad.

This was also kind of hilarious, but I didn't have time to appreciate the humor because I'd accidentally DRUGGED an entire church potluck with the wrong coffee and—

"Rena?"

Pastor Jack Coleman. Jennifer's pastor. My landlord (well, his wife Becky is co-landlord, but still). The man who'd given me a chance when I had nothing but a car accident settlement and a dream about perfect coffee.

He was standing next to me, watching the chaos.

I opened my mouth to apologize. To explain. To maybe cry and beg forgiveness and promise to never bring coffee anywhere ever again.

He started laughing.

Not a polite chuckle. Not a "this is awkward but I'll be gracious" laugh.

A full, genuine, can't-catch-your-breath, tears-streaming-down-your-face LAUGH.

"Did you—" he gasped, "did you switch the coffee?"

"I didn't MEAN to," I said, my voice going up approximately four octaves. "I had a COLOR-CODED SYSTEM. There was tape. Blue tape and red tape. And then I forgot to actually USE the tape and I just GUESSED which one was which and apparently I guessed WRONG and now Mrs. Williams is debating soteriology and Brandon is ASLEEP and I've ruined Wednesday night potluck and—"

"Rena."

Pastor Jack put a hand on my shoulder.

"This is the most honest church service we've had in years."

I stared at him.

"Look at them," he said, gesturing to the seniors. "When's the last time you saw Mrs. Chen that passionate about Scripture? When's the last time Mr. Patterson moved faster than a slow walk? They're ENGAGED. They're wrestling with real theology. They're—" He paused, wiping his eyes. "They're AWAKE."

"They're overcaffeinated," I said weakly.

"Same thing." He grinned. "And Brandon—" He looked over at the sleeping youth pastor. "Honestly, he needed the nap. We've been running him ragged. Maybe this is God's way of saying 'sit down for five minutes, son.'"

---

Mrs. Williams appeared at my elbow. I hadn't seen her approach. She moved like a caffeinated ninja.

"Dear," she said, "could you possibly mess up the coffee again next month? I haven't felt this alive in YEARS."

I made a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob.

"I'll take that as a yes," Mrs. Williams said, patting my hand. Then she returned to her theological debate, moving at speeds that seemed physically improbable for someone her age.

Jennifer found me ten minutes later in the church kitchen. I was sitting on the floor, back against the cabinet, still holding an empty serving spoon for some reason.

"You okay?" she asked.

"I think I finally understand grace," I said.

She slid down to sit next to me. "Yeah?"

"I had this whole PLAN," I said. "Color-coded. Organized. Perfect. And then I forgot the most important part and everything got mixed up and it should have been a disaster but somehow..." I gestured vaguely toward the fellowship hall, where I could still hear the animated hum of conversation. "Somehow it's the best thing I've brought to this church."

Jennifer was quiet for a moment. Then: "You know what Pastor Jack says? 'God works best in the mess.'"

"That's either very encouraging or very concerning," I said.

"It's both. That's faith."

We sat there on the kitchen floor, and I thought about Romans 8:28: "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."

ALL things.

Even unlabeled airpots.

Even forgotten tape.

Even standing in a church kitchen on a Wednesday night, realizing that maybe—just MAYBE—my chaos isn't a flaw.

Maybe it's part of the design.

---

By 8:30 PM, both groups had switched locations. The seniors were winding down (though still more animated than usual—caffeine takes a while to wear off). The youth group was finally perking up. Brandon woke up and immediately apologized seventeen times until Pastor Jack told him to stop and go take the teenagers for ice cream.

I was packing up the airpots when Mrs. Williams approached again.

"You know," she said, "I've been going to church for sixty-seven years. I've heard a LOT of sermons about grace. But tonight—watching everyone respond to your coffee mix-up—that taught me more about grace than most of those sermons."

"How?" I asked.

"Because grace isn't about getting everything right," she said. "It's about God using our imperfect offerings anyway. You brought coffee. It got mixed up. And somehow that mess created space for real conversation, real rest, real community." She smiled. "That's what grace does. It takes our messy offerings and makes them beautiful."

I may have cried a little.

Okay, I definitely cried a little.

Mrs. Williams hugged me—surprisingly strong grip for someone that small—and then returned to her group, still debating whether salvation could be lost (she's firmly in the "once saved, always saved" camp, apparently).

---

I drove home with two empty airpots, still no idea which had been regular and which had been decaf, and a strange sense of peace.

Mother's voice tried to creep in: *"See? You can't even manage a simple task. You always mess things up."*

But for once, I had an answer: *Maybe. But maybe God uses mess-ups. Maybe the point isn't perfection. Maybe the point is showing up with what you have, even if it gets mixed up, even if you forget the tape, even if you accidentally caffeinate the elderly and sedate the youth group.*

*Maybe that's enough.*

I got back to my apartment and realized I'd been so focused on the coffee disaster that I'd forgotten to actually EAT anything at the potluck. So I made myself a grilled cheese (burned it slightly, because of course I did) and sat in the oversized chair Linda sent me, wearing jeans, eating mediocre grilled cheese, and feeling... grateful.

For messed-up coffee.

For Mrs. Williams's unexpected theology debate.

For Pastor Jack's laughter.

For Jennifer sitting with me on a kitchen floor.

For grace that works in the mess.

For a God who apparently doesn't require color-coded tape.

The Hot Mess opens in three weeks. I still don't have all the permits. I still don't know if I ordered enough supplies. I still wake up at 3 AM worried about ceiling stains and health codes and whether anyone will actually show up.

But tonight taught me something:

God can work with unlabeled airpots.

He can definitely work with me.

[^1]: This is probably a conservative estimate. I've been making coffee since I was ten years old. That's a LOT of coffee. I should probably have stockholder privileges at several coffee bean companies by now.

[^2]: The stain was water damage from when the previous tenant's upstairs neighbor had a pipe leak. Todd assured me it's not a health code violation. I still googled it seventeen more times to be sure.
