So.

Here's the thing about me and technology: we have what I'd call a "complicated relationship." The kind where I accidentally close seventeen browser tabs while trying to open one, and the WiFi router has learned to reset itself preemptively when it senses my anxiety levels rising.

Which is all to say—we're moving.

Not the shop. The shop is staying exactly where it is, between Earl's antiques and Jamie's flowers, with the same creaky door and the same espresso machine that has opinions about Mondays.[^1]

No, we're moving *this*. The blog. The words. The place where I info-dump about coffee and accidentally reveal too much about my feelings toward certain equipment repair professionals.

**[The new home:](https://the-hot-mess.untitledpublishers.com)**

https://the-hot-mess.untitledpublishers.com

We should be fully up and running by **February 6th**.

In the meantime, things might get... messy. Which, yes, I recognize the irony. Technical glitches. Broken links. Pages that load like they're being hand-delivered by a very tired pigeon. You know—reconstruction.

If something looks weird or doesn't work, just assume I'm standing somewhere in the digital equivalent of a puddle, completely unaware, while coffee grounds materialize in impossible locations.

I'll see you on the other side.

Same stories. Same chaos. Same me.
