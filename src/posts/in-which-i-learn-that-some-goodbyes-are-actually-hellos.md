There's a table by the window—second from the door, the one that catches the morning light in a way that makes everything look like it belongs in a coffee commercial—and for four years, it belonged to Sophia.

Not officially. I don't have a reservation system. I barely have a functioning point-of-sale system, and the less said about my attempt to set up mobile ordering, the better.[^1] But every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 7:45 AM, Sophia walked through that door with a backpack that weighed approximately forty-seven pounds and a look on her face that said "I have an 8 AM lecture and I am not emotionally prepared for it," and she sat at that table. Every time.

I always had her oat milk latte ready by 7:47.

She never asked how I knew. I never told her I'd been watching the clock since 7:40. Some things don't need to be said.

---

Four years.

That's 416 Tuesday and Thursday mornings, give or take. That's 832 oat milk lattes. That's one college student transforming from a terrified freshman who whispered her order like she was afraid the menu might judge her, to a senior who walked in last week and said, "Rena, I need you to make me the strongest thing legally possible, I have a thesis defense in three hours and I've forgotten how to form sentences."

I made her a triple-shot with an extra pump of vanilla because some moments call for both caffeine and comfort.

She survived the defense. Obviously. Sophia survives everything.

I didn't know, that morning, that it was almost over. That the countdown had already started.

---

Tuesday morning.

7:45. The door chimes.

Sophia walked in looking different than usual. Not the "I-have-an-exam-and-death-would-be-preferable" look. Not the "my-study-group-cancelled-again" look. Something else. Something I couldn't read.

"Hey," she said, sliding into her chair.

"Hey yourself." I was already steaming the oat milk, muscle memory taking over. The milk pitcher was doing that thing where it vibrates slightly when you hit the right temperature—between 140 and 150 degrees is optimal for oat milk because it has a lower fat content than dairy, so you can't push it as hot without ruining the proteins and making it taste like cardboard, which is a thing I know because I'm insufferable about milk temperatures and also because I ruined approximately seventeen lattes before I figured it out.

"Rena."

I looked up. The milk was done. Perfect microfoam. I was standing in a small puddle of water from where the steam wand had dripped, but that's just a normal Tuesday.

"I got the job," Sophia said.

"THE job? The one in—"

"Seattle."

I set down the milk pitcher. Carefully. I have a history of not setting things down carefully.

"Sophia. Oh my gosh. SOPHIA."

"I know."

"You GOT it. You actually—the one you interviewed for three times? The one with the—"

"The sustainability consultancy. Yeah." She was grinning now, that wide-open smile I'd seen maybe a dozen times in four years. When she passed organic chemistry. When she got into the honors program. When she told me about her first real date with that guy from her study group (who turned out to be terrible, but the smile was real in the moment).

"This is amazing. This is—wait. Seattle."

"Seattle."

The word sat between us.

Seattle is 2,800 miles away. I know because I looked it up later, after she left, sitting on the floor of my stockroom surrounded by boxes of coffee filters because I needed to be somewhere small while I processed something big.

"When?" I asked.

"Two weeks."

Two weeks. Fourteen days. Seven more Tuesday-Thursday pairs. Except she wouldn't be coming for most of those because there would be graduation and packing and saying goodbye to everyone and everything, and—

"I'm so proud of you," I said, and my voice cracked on the last word, which was embarrassing.

"Rena."

"I'm fine. I'm totally fine. This is—this is what's supposed to happen. This is good. This is—"

I was crying. Apparently. I didn't realize until I went to wipe my face and there were tears, which explained why everything looked blurry and also why Sophia was getting up from her chair and coming around the counter, which customers aren't supposed to do, but I wasn't about to enforce that rule while having a small emotional crisis at 7:52 in the morning.

"I didn't mean to make you cry," she said.

"I cry at everything. I cried at a commercial for car insurance last week. Jennifer says I'm 'emotionally available.' I think that's a nice way of saying I'm a mess."

Sophia laughed. That surprised laugh she does when she's not expecting something to be funny.

"You're not a mess," she said. "You're the opposite of a mess."

"I'm literally standing in a puddle right now."

"Okay, but the coffee is perfect."

That's the thing about The Hot Mess. The coffee IS perfect. It's everything else that's negotiable.

---

She didn't stay long that morning. She had things to do. People to tell. A life to pack up and transport across the country to a city I've never seen, full of people I'll never meet, where she'll drink coffee that I didn't make.

I'm happy for her. I want that to be clear. I am genuinely, bone-deep happy that Sophia got this job, that she's going to do amazing things, that she's becoming whoever she's supposed to become.

But I'm also sad.

I don't think those two things cancel each other out. I think you can hold them both at the same time, happiness and grief, braided together so tightly you can't tell where one ends and the other begins.

I've been practicing that. Holding two things at once. It's harder than it sounds.

---

The next few days were strange. I found myself watching for her even when I knew she wouldn't come. Checking the clock at 7:40 on a Wednesday, just in case. Muscle memory doesn't know about goodbyes.

I kept her table clean. Someone else sat there on Friday—a guy with a laptop and those giant headphones that make people look like they're piloting a spaceship—and I had to resist the urge to say "actually, that seat is taken."

It wasn't taken. It was just empty.

Different things.

---

Jennifer came by Saturday afternoon with that look on her face that means she's about to Fix Everything. Jennifer is very good at Fixing Everything, even when Everything doesn't necessarily want to be fixed.

"Heard about Sophia," she said, sliding into the chair across from where I was doing inventory. (Badly. I kept losing count of the coffee sleeves because my brain kept wandering.)

"Word travels fast."

"She posted on Instagram. 'Goodbye Birmingham, hello Seattle, couldn't have survived college without my favorite coffee shop.' She tagged you. Well, she tagged The Hot Mess. Same thing."

I hadn't seen the post. I'm terrible at social media. My Instagram for the shop gets updated approximately once a month when Jennifer physically takes my phone and does it for me.

"That's nice," I said.

"You're doing the thing."

"What thing?"

"The thing where you pretend you're fine when you're actually sad because you don't want to make it about you when it's supposed to be happy for someone else."

Jennifer is annoyingly perceptive sometimes. I love her for it. I also find it extremely inconvenient.

"It IS happy for someone else," I said. "I'm happy for her. I'm allowed to also be sad that I won't see her anymore."

"Are you, though?"

"Am I what?"

"Allowing yourself." Jennifer tilted her head, studying me with those perfectly-highlighted blonde hair and the expression that says she's about to say something I don't want to hear. "Because it looks more like you're pushing it down so you can keep functioning, which is a thing you do."

I opened my mouth to argue.

Then I closed it.

Because she wasn't wrong.

---

Here's what I've learned about grief, even the small kind:

It doesn't follow rules.

I thought I'd be sad when Sophia actually left. When she drove away. When her table sat empty and stayed empty. I didn't expect to be sad NOW, while she was still here, while there were still days left.

But grief doesn't wait for the ending. Sometimes it shows up early, moving in before the loss even happens, setting up shop in your chest like it's paying rent.

Mother would have something to say about this. She'd probably quote Ecclesiastes—"To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven." She'd mean it as comfort. It would land as "stop being dramatic."

But I've been reading Ecclesiastes differently lately. There's a time to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. It doesn't say the weeping is wrong. It doesn't say mourning is weakness. It just says there's a time for it.

Maybe this is that time.

Sophia's last official day was a Thursday.

She came in at 7:45. Right on schedule. One last time.

I'd been there since 5 AM, which is not unusual—I'm always here early, that's when I do the prep work and have my quiet time before the chaos starts—but I'd also been stress-cleaning since 4:30 because I couldn't sleep. The espresso machine had never been more polished. The counter had been wiped down seven times. I'd reorganized the syrup bottles twice because apparently that's what I do when I don't know how to handle emotions: I alphabetize things.

The door chimed.

She walked in.

She was wearing a t-shirt that said "Seattle or Bust" with a little coffee cup graphic, and she was carrying two things: her usual enormous backpack and a small envelope.

"Hey," she said.

"Hey yourself." My voice was steady. I'd practiced.

I made her latte. One last time. Oat milk, steamed to 145 degrees, two shots of espresso pulled at exactly 25 seconds each, just a touch of vanilla because she liked it that way even though she'd never told me to add it—I'd just noticed, back in her sophomore year, that her face lit up slightly more when there was vanilla.

You notice things when someone comes in 416 times.

She took the cup. Wrapped her hands around it. Didn't drink yet.

"I have something for you," she said.

"You don't have to—"

"I know I don't have to." She slid the envelope across the counter. "But I wanted to."

I looked at it. Small. Square. My name written on the front in careful handwriting.

"Can I open it now, or is this an 'open it after I leave' situation?"

"Now is fine."

I picked it up. My hands were shaking slightly. I blamed the espresso, which was a lie—I'd only had one cup.

Inside was a card. Pale blue. A little watercolor coffee cup on the front, slightly wonky, like someone had painted it themselves. On the inside:

*Rena,*

*You probably don't know this, but this place kept me sane for four years.*

*I came here when I didn't know where else to go. When I failed my first midterm. When my parents told me they were getting divorced. When Ethan and I broke up. When I changed my major (both times) and everyone said I was making a mistake.*

*I came here, and you always remembered my order. You always asked how my exams went. You never made me feel like I was taking up too much space or staying too long or being too much.*

*That mattered more than you know.*

*I'm opening a coffee shop in Seattle. Not right away—I need to save money first, and learn more, and probably fail at a few things first. But someday. That's the plan.*

*I learned how from watching you.*

*You didn't just serve me coffee. You showed me what I want to do with my life.*

*Thank you for everything. For the lattes. For the window seat. For remembering.*

*Sophia*

*P.S. The oat milk thing? I'm actually not lactose intolerant. I just heard you talking about the steaming temperature differences once and thought it sounded cool. Four years of oat milk because you made it sound interesting. That's the kind of person you are.*

---

I was crying.

Obviously.

Standing behind the counter of my coffee shop at 7:53 in the morning, holding a card I'd already read twice, tears running down my face while a college student I'd watched grow up stood on the other side of the counter with her own wet eyes and an embarrassed smile.

"I wasn't supposed to make YOU cry," I said.

"You didn't. I was already crying when I wrote it."

I laughed. It came out soggy. I didn't care.

"Sophia."

"Yeah?"

"You're going to be amazing." I meant it. I meant it more than I'd meant almost anything. "And when your espresso machine breaks—and it WILL break, they always break, especially the first one you buy because you'll think you can save money and you CAN'T, the cheap ones are cheap for a reason and the gaskets fail within six months—call Todd. He's the best. He knows coffee equipment like I know... coffee."

"Who's Todd?"

"My repair guy. He's in Birmingham but he'll know someone in Seattle. Or he'll fly out there personally. He's that kind of person."

Sophia laughed. "Only you would give someone a repair guy recommendation as a going-away gift."

"It's a GOOD recommendation. Todd has saved Betsy's life approximately seventeen times."

"Betsy?"

"My espresso machine." I paused. "That's normal. People name their machines. It's a whole thing."

"Sure it is."

"It IS."

She was grinning now. That full grin. The one I'd only seen a dozen times.

Thirteen now.

---

She didn't leave right away. She sat at her table—her table, it would always be her table—and drank her latte slowly, like she was memorizing it. I let her. I had other customers, other orders, but I kept glancing over.

You spend four years watching someone, you don't stop just because the end is coming.

At 8:30, she stood up. Slung her backpack over her shoulder. Walked to the counter one more time.

"Thank you," she said. "For all of it."

"Thank you for coming back."

She hugged me. Quick and fierce, the way you hug someone when you're trying not to cry again.

And then she walked out.

The door chimed.

And she was gone.

---

I watched through the window as she got into her car—a beat-up Honda that had seen better days, packed full of boxes and clothes and the accumulated weight of four years of becoming someone.

She looked back once. Waved.

I waved back.

And then she drove away.

---

I closed early that day.

I never close early. The Hot Mess is open from 6 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Saturday, and I am pathologically incapable of changing the schedule because routines are how I survive and also because my anxiety tells me that if I close early ONCE, the whole business will collapse.

But I closed early.

I locked the door. Flipped the sign. Sat down in Sophia's chair—the one by the window, the one that catches the morning light—and made myself a latte in her usual mug.

Oat milk. Two shots. Just a touch of vanilla.

It tasted like goodbye.

---

I thought about calling Jennifer. She would come. She always comes, with pizza and encouragement and that particular brand of confident optimism that makes everything feel manageable even when it isn't.

But I didn't call her.

Some grief needs space before it needs company.

I sat with it instead. The sadness. The strange, complicated pride. The thing that felt like loss but also felt like something else—something I couldn't name yet.

---

Sophia is going to open a coffee shop.

Because of me.

Because I remembered her order. Because I asked about her exams. Because I made space for her to exist, to sit by the window with her enormous backpack and her quiet panic and her slow transformation into someone who knows what she wants.

I didn't do anything extraordinary. I made coffee. I paid attention. I showed up, day after day, and tried to make this place feel like somewhere people could breathe.

That's it.

That's what planted a dream.

---

I pulled out the card and read it again. Then I opened the drawer behind the counter—the one where I keep the cash box and the emergency chocolate and the small collection of things I can't throw away.

There's a five-dollar bill in there from the first homeless man who ever bought coffee here. He'd saved up for a week to afford it. He told me that. He said, "I just wanted to buy something in a place like this. Like a regular person." I'd tried to give it back, but he wouldn't let me. "You earned it," he said. "Let me pay like everyone else."

There's a laminated coffee sleeve that a kid decorated with markers while her mom had a phone call. She gave it to me when they left. "For your collection," she said, even though I didn't have a collection. I do now.

There's a photo someone left behind—a polaroid of two old women laughing over cups of coffee. I don't know who they are. They never came back for it. But they looked so happy, and I couldn't throw it away.

And now there's Sophia's card.

My collection of evidence that what I do matters.

Growing all the time.

---

I texted her that night.

*You're going to be amazing. And when your espresso machine breaks, call Todd. He's the best.*

She responded with a heart emoji.

Simple. Perfect.

Goodbye isn't always an ending. Sometimes it's a seed.

---

Here's what I'm learning, sitting in this coffee shop that somehow became a place where people figure out who they want to be:

You never know who's watching.

You never know what small thing—the remembered order, the question about the exam, the extra pump of vanilla nobody asked for—will take root in someone. What they'll carry with them when they leave. What will bloom in a city you'll never visit, in a coffee shop you'll never see.

Some of what you pour into people travels further than you do.

That's terrifying, if you think about it. The idea that you're planting seeds without knowing. That your presence ripples out in ways you can't track or measure or control.

But it's also beautiful.

Because it means the work matters. Even when you can't see it. Even when the person walks out the door and drives away and starts a whole new life 2,800 miles from the table by the window where they used to sit.

They carry something of you with them.

And you carry something of them.

That's not loss. That's legacy.

---

The next Tuesday, 7:45 came and went.

No chime. No Sophia. No enormous backpack. Just the empty table by the window, morning light falling across it like it always does.

I made an oat milk latte anyway. Set it on the counter. Watched the steam curl.

Then I drank it myself.

Because some rituals are worth keeping, even when the reason for them is gone.

Or maybe not gone. Just... somewhere else. Taking root. Growing into something I'll never see but will always have helped plant.

The door chimed.

A new customer walked in. Young. Nervous. The kind of nervous that says "I don't know if I belong here."

"Welcome to The Hot Mess," I said. "What can I get you?"

She looked at the menu. Then at me. Then at the table by the window.

"Is that seat taken?"

I smiled.

"It's all yours."

---

*Coffee so good, it's worth the chaos.*

*Goodbyes so hard, they might actually be hellos.*

*Welcome to The Hot Mess. Stay as long as you need. You never know what seeds you're planting—or which ones are being planted in you.*

---

[^1]: I spent four hours trying to connect the iPad to the Square reader. Todd eventually just came over and did it in six minutes. He didn't even charge me for the visit. Just fixed it, patted Betsy on the side like she was a loyal dog, and left. I may have cried a little.
