Jennifer arrives at 7:03 AM with a clipboard.

This is never a good sign.

"Today," she announces, letting the door bang shut behind her, "is your day off."

"I don't have days off," I say, because I don't. The Hot Mess is open six days a week and on the seventh day I do inventory and cry gently into spreadsheets.

"You do now." She waves the clipboard at me. It has a list. The list has bullet points. The bullet points have sub-bullets. "I've planned everything. You close at 2, we go to Milly's for a late lunch, then we do something fun."

"Something fun is very vague."

"It's intentionally vague. For mystery." She beams at me. "You're going to love it."

I do not think I'm going to love it.

But Jennifer is already behind the counter, tying on an apron that appeared from somewhere—did she bring her own apron?—and I'm standing there holding my coffee like a woman who has lost control of her own shop.

"Jennifer," I start.

"Nope." She holds up a hand. "No arguing. You work too hard. I'm helping. This is me helping."

Here's the thing about Jennifer: she's my best friend.

She's the person who invited me to church seventeen times before I said yes. She's the person who showed up with pizza and paint when I was alone and terrified in an empty shop. She's the person who believes in me more than I believe in myself, which is beautiful and also occasionally suffocating.

Jennifer helps. It's her love language. It's how she says "I care about you" when words feel insufficient. And usually, I love it.

Today is not usually.

Today I woke up at 4 AM with anxiety about the quarterly taxes. Today the milk delivery was late again. Today I have a headache that started somewhere behind my left eye and has colonized most of my skull. Today I want to stand behind my counter, make coffee, and not talk to anyone about anything.

But Jennifer is here. With a clipboard. And a plan.
