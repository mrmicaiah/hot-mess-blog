Todd walks into The Hot Mess at 2:47 on a Thursday afternoon without a toolbox, which is how I know something is wrong. Or right. Or different. Todd without a toolbox is like me without coffee grounds on my person — technically possible but deeply unsettling, a violation of the natural order that suggests the universe has shifted on its axis and nobody sent a memo.

He nods at me the way he always does, which is Todd's version of a soliloquy, and he sits on the stool closest to the register — not his usual, which means this is a purpose visit.[^1]

"Betsy's fine," I say, because this is how we start. Equipment status as greeting. It's what we have instead of small talk, and I prefer it because small talk requires a skill set I was not issued at birth, whereas espresso machine diagnostics I can do in my sleep.

"I know," he says. "I'm not here for Betsy."

Four words. Todd uses words like other people use expensive olive oil — sparingly, intentionally, aware of the cost. So when he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a business card and sets it on the counter between us, I understand that this small gesture contains more information than most people's entire paragraphs.

The card is cream-colored, good stock, simple font. **Martin & West — New American Kitchen.** Below that, an address in Whitfield — the next town over, twenty minutes east, the kind of place that's been building itself a downtown for the last five years with farm-to-table restaurants and a bookshop that sells candles. Below the address: **James Martin, Executive Chef.** And below that, a phone number with a handwritten note in the margin, in handwriting that isn't Todd's: *Call me about coffee. Todd says you're the one.*

Todd says you're the one.

I read it three times. The words don't rearrange themselves into something less terrifying.

"Jim's opening in April," Todd says, as if he's reporting weather conditions. Light breeze, partly cloudy, a man in the next town wants to hire you as a coffee consultant. "He's sourcing local. Needs someone who knows beans." He pauses. "That wasn't a pun."

"It was a little bit a pun."

"It wasn't. Jim needs a supplier and a consultant. Someone to build his coffee program — sourcing, roast profiles, drink menu, training. He asked if I knew anyone." Todd picks up the card, looks at it, sets it back down like he's making sure it landed where he intended. "I gave him your name."

The shop is quiet — Thursday afternoon lull, the dead zone between the lunch rush and the after-school trickle. One student at the big table, headphones on, laptop open, typing too loud. The piano hymns are doing their thing, something slow and steady that I can't name right now because my brain is fully occupied with the task of not visibly panicking.

"Todd."

"Yeah."

"I'm not — I don't have a — " I gesture at the space around me, which is a coffee shop I own, which is a place where I make coffee every day, which is evidence of exactly the thing I'm about to deny. "I'm not a consultant."

"Okay."

"I don't have a portfolio. I don't have credentials. I have a shop and an espresso machine with mood swings and a customer base that includes a man who draws smiley faces in his cup and a woman whose order requires a flowchart. I didn't go to — there's no coffee school, Todd, that's not a thing, except actually it is, there are programs in Portland and Seattle and I looked into them once at 2 AM but they cost more than my car and my car isn't worth much because there's a rose still lodged in the cup holder from Jamie's flower disaster —"

"Rena."

"— and Jennifer made me business cards once on Canva but she spelled 'espresso' with an X, which isn't — I mean, she tried, but you can't hand someone a card that says 'expresso' and expect them to take you seriously as a coffee professional —"

"Rena."

I stop. I'm gripping the counter with both hands. My knuckles are white. I've been talking for — I don't know how long. Long enough that the student has taken off one headphone and is watching me with the cautious fascination of someone observing a wildlife event.

Todd is looking at me. His expression hasn't changed, which is the most Todd thing about Todd — the complete, immovable calm in the face of whatever I'm doing, which right now is spiraling about my own incompetence while standing in a coffee shop I built from nothing in a converted bakery space with original tin ceilings and a book exchange shelf that has its own quiet life and a community bulletin board with Romans 8:1 in the center and six tables where people come every day because the coffee is good.

The coffee is good. The coffee has always been good. The coffee is the one thing that has never not been good.

"You done?" Todd asks.

"Probably not."

"Jim doesn't need a portfolio. He needs someone who knows the difference between a Yirgacheffe and a Sumatran and can explain why it matters. He needs someone who can build a menu that makes sense for a farm-to-table kitchen. He needs someone who can taste a roast and tell him whether it's right." Todd taps the card once. "He needs you."

"You don't know that."

"I fixed your machine six times. I've watched you explain coffee origins to a man who ordered drip. I've watched you match drinks to people who didn't know what they wanted. I've watched you pull shots while your ceiling was leaking and not miss a single one." He picks up the card one more time and places it in front of me with a precision that feels deliberate, almost ceremonial. "You've been ready. You've been ready since before you opened this place."

I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. This is what happens when someone says something true and your body hasn't decided yet whether to accept it or run from it — you just stand there with your mouth doing an impression of a fish that's been confronted with an existential question about the nature of water.

Something is happening in my chest. It's warm and tight and slightly terrifying, like the first sip of something too hot that you drink anyway because you need it.

"He said — " I look at the card again. *Todd says you're the one.* "You said I was 'the one'?"

"I said you were the one to call about coffee."

"That's what you said."

"That's what I said."

We look at each other for approximately two seconds, which is one second longer than Todd usually holds eye contact and approximately forty-five minutes shorter than I'd like, and then he looks at the counter and I look at the espresso machine and the moment passes the way moments between us always pass — unresolved, unspoken, alive.

"I should get back to the shop," he says.

"Right. Yeah. Of course."

He stands. He's already at the door when I realize I haven't —

"Todd."

He turns. The bell is still swinging from where he pushed the door.

"Thank you. For — for telling Jim. For thinking of me."

He looks at me for a long moment. "I didn't think of you. You were obvious."

The bell rings when the door closes behind him. The student puts her headphone back on. The piano hymns continue. Thursday afternoon resumes its ordinary shape, except there's a business card on my counter and my hands are shaking and someone in the next town thinks I know what I'm doing because Todd told him I did.

I pick up the card and walk to the back room.

This is my spot — the floor in front of the deep freeze, where I slide down the wall and hug my knees when I need a moment that's smaller than the shop allows. The deep freeze hums against my back. The floor is cold. The storage shelves are stacked with beans from Riverside — Colombian and Ethiopian and Guatemalan and Kenyan, each one a different origin, a different story, a different set of flavor notes I could describe in my sleep because I've been studying this since I was ten years old, since Dad brought home a book about coffee roasting and I read it cover to cover and then read it again and then started reading everything else I could find, which was limited in an IFB household but I found ways, I always found ways, because this was the one thing that was mine before anything else was mine.

I know coffee.

I know that Ethiopian Yirgacheffe has floral and jasmine notes and that the light roast preserves the origin character. I know that a cortado is espresso with equal parts steamed milk and that the ratio matters more than the temperature. I know that the bloom in a pour-over should last thirty seconds and that the difference between good and great lives in the seconds you're willing to wait. And I know these things not because someone credentialed me but because I loved them first and studied them second and practiced them third, and the practice hasn't stopped, not once, not in nine months of making coffee for people who come back because it's good.

Because I'm good at this.

I sit on the floor holding a business card from a restaurant I've never been to, and I let that sentence exist without arguing with it.

I'm good at this.[^2]

The deep freeze hums. The storage room is quiet. Upstairs, Mabel is probably on the chair, doing what Mabel does, which is exist with total confidence in her right to take up space. I could learn something from the cat.

I stand up. I put the card in my apron pocket. I go back out to the counter and I make myself a cortado — not because I need it, but because I want to watch my hands do the thing they know how to do. Pull the shot. Steam the milk. Knock the milk pitcher lid off the counter with my elbow, hear it clatter across the floor, don't stop, don't look. The ratio exact. Twenty seconds of absolute competence and one piece of falling equipment in a life that's mostly held together with coffee grounds and good intentions.

I drink it standing up, leaning against the counter, looking at my shop. The tin ceiling. The brick walls. The book exchange shelf. Lily's daisy mug on the shelf behind me. Noah's scoop. The bulletin board with Romans 8:1 in the center, the verse that got me out and keeps me here.

*If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come.*

I don't think about that verse often — it's not my anchor, not the one I reach for when the guilt comes. But standing here, holding a cortado I made without thinking, with a business card in my pocket from a man who wants to meet with me about coffee because Todd told him I was the one to call — I think maybe new creation isn't a single moment. It's not the day you leave or the day you open the shop or the day someone hands you a card. It's the accumulation. It's every cup you make and every morning you show up and every time someone sees you and you let them be right about what they see.

The student finishes her work and waves on her way out. The bell rings. Thursday afternoon light shifts through the front window — February gold, thin but present, trying.

I pull out my phone. I look at the card. I type the number in.

I don't call yet. But I type it in.

That's enough for today.

[^1]: The problem is that I have memorized which stool he sits on depending on whether he's here for Betsy (third from left), for a social visit (second from right), or for something specific (closest to register). I have also memorized his coffee order (cortado), his jacket (three, rotating), and the exact way he says "tools have survived worse" when I apologize for knocking things over. This is data I didn't ask my brain to collect. My brain collected it anyway. We're in disagreement about what this means.

[^2]: This might be the first time I've thought that sentence without immediately following it with "but." I'm going to sit with it for a minute before the but shows up. It always shows up. But not yet.
