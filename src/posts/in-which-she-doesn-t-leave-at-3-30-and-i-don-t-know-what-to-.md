Thursdays at 3 PM, I have a black coffee ready before the bell finishes ringing.

Grace doesn't know I do this. Or maybe she does and has chosen not to acknowledge it, which would be very Grace of her—accepting the small kindness without making it into a thing. She comes in, walks to the counter, and I slide the cup across like it just happened to be there. She pays. She doesn't tip, which used to bother me until I realized that tipping would make this transactional, and whatever this is, it isn't that.

She takes the corner table. The one by the window. The one with the view of St. Francis Memorial's cemetery.

She sits for exactly thirty minutes. She doesn't read. Doesn't look at her phone. Just sits, hands wrapped around the cup, looking out at the headstones.

At 3:30, she leaves. Every Thursday. For two years.

I don't know which headstone is her daughter's. I've never asked. I'm not even sure Grace knows I know—that one afternoon eighteen months ago when she came in crying and told me everything: the car accident, the three-year anniversary, how Thursday was the day they used to get coffee together after her daughter's Thursday classes.

She's never mentioned it again. I've never brought it up.

Some things don't need to be discussed. They just need to be held.

Today is Thursday. 3 PM. The bell rings.

I slide the coffee across. Grace takes it. Same ritual. Same silence. She's wearing a gray blazer today, hair pulled back, the kind of professional armor that says she came straight from work. She looks tired in a way that isn't about sleep.

She sits at the corner table. Hands around the cup. Eyes on the cemetery.

I go back to wiping down the espresso machine, which doesn't need wiping but gives me something to do with my hands. The shop is quiet—that midafternoon lull when the lunch crowd has gone and the after-work crowd hasn't arrived. Just me and Grace and the hiss of the radiator and the soft piano hymns I keep on low because silence feels too loud sometimes.

3:15. She hasn't moved.

3:25. Still there.

3:30.

She doesn't get up.

I check the clock twice because maybe I miscounted, maybe I lost track, but no—it's 3:32 now and Grace is still sitting at the corner table, still looking out the window, and this has never happened before. Two years of Thursdays and she has never stayed past 3:30.

3:37. I'm starting to spiral.[^1]

Is she okay? Should I check on her? But checking on her would break the unspoken agreement we have, which is that I provide coffee and she provides... presence, I guess, the quiet proof that The Hot Mess is a place where you can sit with your grief without anyone trying to fix it.

3:42. She still hasn't moved.

I make a decision. It might be the wrong one, but I make it anyway—I pour a second cup of black coffee and I walk over to the corner table and I stand there like an idiot until she looks up.

"Can I sit?" I ask.

She looks at me for a long moment. Then she nods.

I sit across from her. Set the second cup between us. An offering. She doesn't take it, but she doesn't tell me to leave either.

"I'm not—" I start, then stop because I don't actually know what I'm not. "I'm not trying to intrude. I just noticed you're still here, and I wanted to make sure you were okay. But also you don't have to be okay. You can just sit. I can leave. I'm very good at leaving.[^2] I just—"

"Rena."

I stop talking. It's the first time she's ever said my name.

"Today is four years."

Four years. I do the math. The anniversary. The accident.

"I thought..." She pauses. Looks back at the cemetery. "I thought I would fall apart. I always fall apart on this day. But I got here at 3, and I sat down, and I realized—"

She stops. Her jaw tightens.

"I don't know how to say this without it sounding like a Hallmark card."

"I work in a coffee shop with a Bible verse on the bulletin board," I say. "I can handle a Hallmark card."

Something flickers across her face. Not quite a smile, but close.

"This table," she says slowly. "This window. This cup of coffee that's always ready before I ask for it." She looks at me. "I used to come here to grieve. To sit with it. To prove I could survive another thirty minutes."

I nod. I don't say anything.

"Today I realized I'm not just surviving anymore." Her voice catches. "I'm... staying. Not because I have to. Because I want to."

Something shifts in my chest.

"That's not a Hallmark card," I say quietly. "That's hope."

She looks at me like I've said something she didn't expect. Then she picks up the second cup of coffee—the one I brought over, the one she didn't ask for.

"Yeah," she says. "I think maybe it is."

She leaves at 4:15.

I stand at the corner table after she's gone, looking out at the cemetery. The headstones are gray against the snow. The light is starting to fade.

I think about Grace, sitting here every Thursday for two years, marking time. Thirty minutes of grief, measured and contained, a ritual that meant she could get through the week.

And then today—staying longer. Not because the grief is gone. But because something else has grown up next to it.

Hope isn't the absence of loss. It's the staying when you don't have to anymore.

The coffee cup she left behind is empty.

I take it back to the counter. Wash it myself.

[^1]: Spiraling is perhaps my most consistent spiritual practice.

[^2]: Objectively false. I'm terrible at leaving. I once stayed at a party for three hours because I couldn't figure out how to say goodbye.
