The scones are burning.

I can smell it from across the shop—that particular char that means I got distracted again, probably by the espresso grinder which has been making a noise like a wounded animal since yesterday, or possibly by my own thoughts which have been doing something similar. By the time I yank the tray from the oven, they're not ruined exactly, but they're definitely what Jennifer would call "rustic" and what an honest person would call "aggressively brown."

I set them on the cooling rack anyway because waste is a sin[^1] and also because I'm too tired to start over.

It's 5:47 AM. The shop doesn't open for another hour. I've already knocked over the container of cinnamon (again), spilled half a bag of beans trying to refill the hopper, and discovered that the milk delivery didn't come, which means I'm going to be rationing oat milk like it's the apocalypse.

Some mornings feel like proof that you're doing something meaningful. This is not one of those mornings.

This is a morning that feels like proof that you're just a woman standing in a converted bakery, burning things and pretending you know what you're doing.

I pour myself a drip coffee—no pour-over today, no careful ritual, just caffeine in the fastest possible container—and stand at the counter watching nothing happen on Main Street. It's still dark. The street lamps are doing their best. Somewhere across the street, St. Francis Memorial's sign flickers the way it does when the temperature drops below twenty.

And then I remember: Noah's coffee.

It started seven months ago, at 2 AM on a Tuesday.

The smoke alarm in my apartment decided to malfunction—not a fire, just a sensor that had apparently chosen violence—and I was standing on my bed in pajamas, hitting it with a broom handle, when someone knocked on my door.

Noah. From down the hall. Seventies, maybe older. I'd seen him in the stairwell exactly twice. He'd never said a word either time, just nodded and kept moving, and I'd assumed he was one of those neighbors who preferred to pretend the hallway was a series of isolated tunnels rather than a shared space.

But there he was at 2 AM with a stepladder.

He didn't ask what was wrong. Didn't introduce himself. Just set up the ladder, climbed up, pressed the reset button I hadn't known existed, climbed down, folded the ladder, and nodded.

"Thank you," I said, because I was raised with manners even if I was also raised with trauma. "I'm Rena. I run the coffee shop downstairs. Can I—do you want some coffee sometime? As a thank you?"

He looked at me for a long moment. Then he said—the first words I ever heard him speak—"I don't go out much."

And he left.

The next morning, I left a cup of coffee outside his door. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, because I'd made a pour-over for myself and it seemed like the kind of thing you give someone who just saved you from death by smoke alarm at 2 AM.[^2] I didn't knock. Just left it and went downstairs.

That evening, when I came back up, the cup was outside my door. Empty. Washed.

Seven months. That's 213 cups of coffee, give or take the days I was too sick or too overwhelmed or too caught up in my own disasters to remember. I've never missed more than two days in a row. On the third day, I always remember. Something in me won't let the streak break.

He's never said thank you. Never knocked. Never left a note.

But the cups come back. Always empty. Always washed. Always placed exactly where I left them, like he's maintaining the geometry of the ritual even if he can't participate in the words.

I don't know anything about him. I don't know if he has family, or what he did before he retired, or why his apartment is always silent when I pass—no television, no radio, no music. I don't know what he does all day in that quiet. I don't know if he's lonely or if he prefers it that way.

I just know he drinks Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. And he washes the cups.

This morning, I almost don't do it.

I'm standing in my kitchen—if you can call a corner with a hot plate and mini-fridge a kitchen—holding the pour-over dripper, and I'm thinking: *What's the point?* He doesn't talk to me. He doesn't come into the shop. This is just me, performing faithfulness for an audience of one who may or may not even notice if I stopped.

The scones are still cooling downstairs. The milk didn't come. The grinder sounds like it's dying. And I'm supposed to care about one cup of coffee for a man who's never said my name?

But my hands are already doing it. Heating the water. Measuring the grounds. The muscle memory of showing up.

I leave the cup outside his door at 6:23 AM, same as always. I don't knock. I don't wait.

I go downstairs and open the shop and pretend I'm not having a small crisis about whether any of this matters.

The day is fine. Not good, not terrible—just the kind of fine that feels like treading water. Patricia comes in at her usual time and orders her usual complicated thing and tells me the scones are "interesting," which is Patricia-speak for "these are bad but I appreciate the effort." A college kid spills an entire iced latte on the student table and apologizes so profusely I end up comforting *him*. The grinder keeps making the noise. I keep ignoring it.

At 4 PM, I text Todd: *Grinder's dying. Might need you this week.*

He texts back: *Tomorrow. 7 AM.*

No small talk. No emojis. Just shows up.[^3]

I close at 6. Climb the stairs. Turn the corner toward my apartment.

And stop.

There's something outside my door.

Not a cup. Something else. Small, wrapped in newspaper—actual newspaper, like he's been saving it—tied with kitchen twine. No note. No explanation. Just sitting there on the floor exactly where I always leave his coffee.

I pick it up. Unwrap it.

It's a coffee scoop. Wooden handle, worn smooth from use. Old—decades old, maybe. The kind of thing you find in an antique shop and wonder about. The kind of thing that belonged to someone.

I stand there in the hallway holding it, and I think about the cups.

Always washed. Always returned. Always placed exactly where I left them.

He wasn't just taking the coffee. He was *receiving* it. There's a difference. Taking is passive. Receiving is a response. Receiving says: *I see what you're doing. I'm participating, in the only way I can.*

Two hundred and thirteen cups. Two hundred and thirteen small answers I didn't recognize as answers because I was looking for words.

I knock on his door.

It takes a long time. Long enough that I almost leave. But then I hear shuffling, and the door opens, and there's Noah—thinner than I remembered, older, wearing a cardigan that's seen better decades.

"Thank you," I say, holding up the scoop. "It's beautiful."

He looks at me. Nods once.

"The coffee," I say, and I don't know why I'm saying this except that it feels important, "it's not a debt. You don't owe me anything. I just—I like doing it. I like knowing someone's there."

Another long pause. His eyes are pale blue, watery, and there's something in them I can't quite name.

Then he speaks. Four words, barely above a whisper:

"My wife's. She'd want—" He stops. Swallows. Doesn't finish.

But I understand.

The scoop was hers. The coffee ritual isn't just about him. It's about mornings, and someone showing up, and the faithfulness of small things when the big things have all fallen away.

"I'll take good care of it," I say.

He nods. And for the first time in seven months, I see something that might be a smile.

I don't know Noah's story. I probably never will. He's not going to become a regular at the counter, trading banter while I make his cortado.

But tomorrow morning, I'll heat the water. Measure the grounds. Leave the cup outside his door.

And he'll wash it. And return it. And that will be enough.

*New every morning.*

Some faithfulness is loud—Sunday services, declarations, the big visible showing-up. But some faithfulness is just this: a cup of coffee, left in silence, received in silence, repeated until the repetition itself becomes the language.

I set the wooden scoop next to Betsy. It looks right there.

The scones were terrible. The grinder's still dying. The milk never came.

But I showed up. And so did he.

[^1]: Or at least wasteful, which Mother always said was basically the same thing. She wasn't entirely wrong.

[^2]: Also I'd already made the pour-over and couldn't drink two cups that early without vibrating through walls, so this was partially generosity and partially self-preservation.

[^3]: I'm choosing not to examine why this makes my chest do a thing. That's a problem for another story.
