I opened The Hot Mess this morning at 7 AM planning to serve coffee.

That was the plan. Make espresso. Steam milk. Maybe knock over the sugar caddy once or twice for authenticity. Go home at 6 PM smelling like coffee grounds with foam in my hair. Normal Saturday.

By 6:15 PM, I had apparently solved the teenage rebellion crisis, validated a career change, addressed corporate burnout, and helped process loneliness in the elderly population.

I didn't mean to.

I just made coffee and stood there.

---

It started with Kate—the mom who always orders a double shot latte with oat milk because dairy gives her migraines but she loves coffee too much to quit.¹ She sat at the corner table, the one by the window where the afternoon light makes everything look a little softer, a little more forgiving.

"Can I tell you something?" she said when I brought her refill.

I had coffee grounds on my apron and was mentally calculating whether I had enough Colombian beans to last through Monday. "Of course," I said, because what else do you say?

"My daughter dyed her hair purple. PURPLE. Without asking. She's sixteen and she just... did it. And I'm so angry but also..." She stopped. Looked at her coffee. "Also I remember being sixteen and my mother wouldn't let me cut my hair and I hated it. I hated her for it. For years."

I stood there holding the coffee pot.

"I don't know what to do with that," she said.

"The anger or the memory?" I asked.

She laughed. It came out shaky, like trying to strike a match in the wind. "Both?"

I didn't have an answer. I'm twenty-nine years old and I've been out of my parents' house for less than a year. What do I know about parenting teenagers? What do I know about anything?

So I just said, "That sounds really hard."

And she cried. Right there at the corner table. Not loud crying—quiet crying, the kind that shakes your shoulders while you try to hold your latte steady.

I got her napkins. Refilled her coffee. Sat down across from her for thirty seconds because the shop was empty and she looked so alone.

"Thank you," she said when she left. "I really needed that talk."

Talk. I'd said maybe ten words.

---

Then there was Jordan—early twenties, community college student, always orders black coffee because it's cheapest but tips in quarters like they're made of gold.

"I'm changing my major," he announced, sitting at the counter like he was presenting evidence at trial. "My dad's going to kill me. I'm supposed to do business. He has this whole plan—I'll take over his company, he's been talking about it since I was twelve. But I hate it. I hate business. I want to teach. Elementary school. Second grade specifically. But that's stupid, right? Teaching doesn't pay anything and my dad will think I'm throwing my life away and—"

He stopped. Breathed. Looked at me.

I was wiping down the espresso machine. Had milk splattered on my glasses. Probably had foam in my hair.

"Is it stupid?" he asked.

"Teaching second grade?"

"Yeah."

I thought about being homeschooled. About how Mother taught me reading and arithmetic and fear, all mixed together until I couldn't tell which was which. About how different my life might have been if someone had taught me that learning could be joyful instead of terrifying.

"No," I said. "It's not stupid."

"But my dad—"

"Is not you."

The words came out before I could stop them. Too direct. Too presumptuous. I don't know this kid's family. I don't know his life.

But he sat there, coffee going cold in his hands, and something shifted in his face.

"I'm doing it," he said. "I'm changing my major."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." He stood up. Left a dollar in the tip jar—for him, that's huge. "Thanks for the advice."

I didn't give advice. I made coffee and stated the obvious.

But okay.

The businessman came in at 3 PM—pressed suit, expensive shoes, the kind of watch that costs more than my entire month's rent. He ordered an Americano and sat at the table by the door, laptop open, looking busy.

He sat there for an hour.

Didn't type anything.

Just sat.

When I asked if he needed a refill, he said, "Can I tell you something weird?"

"Weird is kind of my brand," I said, which is true—I was standing in a puddle at the time and didn't notice until later.

"I hate my job." He said it fast, like ripping off a bandage. "I make six figures. I have a company car. I'm up for partner next year. And I hate every single minute of it."

I set the coffee pot down. Grabbed a rag to wipe a table that was already clean because I needed something to do with my hands.

"Do you ever feel like you built this whole life that looks perfect from the outside but feels empty inside?" he asked.

Yes. Yes, I spent almost thirty years in that life. Jean skirts and Bible studies and rules about everything from hair length to humor, and it looked righteous from the outside but inside I was suffocating.

"Yeah," I said. "I do."

"What did you do about it?"

I looked around The Hot Mess. Mismatched furniture. Exposed brick. Coffee grounds on the floor because I'm me and there are always coffee grounds on the floor. My entire life savings invested in this chaotic little space where nothing matches but somehow it all belongs.

"I left," I said. "It was terrifying. Still is, honestly. But I left."

He nodded. Drank his Americano. Stared at his blank laptop screen.

When he left, he shook my hand. "Thank you," he said. "That really helped."

I didn't help. I just told him what I did. That's not advice. That's just... existing out loud.

Then Mrs. Matthews came in at 4:30—she always comes in at 4:30 on Saturdays, orders jasmine tea (I special-order it for her, even though this is a coffee shop, because she asked so politely the first time and I couldn't say no), sits by the window.

Today she sat there for five minutes just holding the cup.

"Are you okay?" I asked.

"My husband died three years ago," she said.

I knew that. She'd mentioned it once, months ago, in passing.

"I thought it would get easier," she continued. "Everyone says it gets easier. But sometimes it gets harder. Sometimes I go whole days without talking to anyone. Just me and the TV. And I think—is this it? Is this the rest of my life?"

I pulled out the chair across from her. Sat down. My shift technically ended at 6 PM but who cares.

"I'm only twenty-nine," I said. "I don't know anything about losing someone like that. But I know about loneliness. I know about wondering if it's always going to feel this way."

"Does it?"

"I don't know yet. But today it feels less lonely than yesterday. So maybe that counts for something."

She smiled. Squeezed my hand across the table. "Thank you, dear. You're a good listener."

I listened because I didn't know what to say.

But apparently that was enough.

By the time I locked the door at 6:15 PM, I was exhausted. Not physically tired—though I was that too, always am after a Saturday.² But emotionally tired. Soul tired. The kind of tired that comes from holding space for other people's pain and not knowing if you held it right.

Todd showed up at 6:20. Knocked on the glass door even though the CLOSED sign was up. I let him in because he had his toolbox and a concerned expression, which usually means Betsy is about to stage a rebellion.

"Just checking on things," he said. "Thought I'd make sure the machine's behaving."

"Betsy's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine." I was sitting on the counter because my feet were tired and the floor seemed very far away.

"I think I accidentally became a therapist today and I'm not qualified for that. I can barely keep a plant alive. I killed a succulent last month. A SUCCULENT. They're supposed to be unkillable."

Todd smiled. Started checking Betsy's pressure gauge anyway because that's what Todd does—shows up, fixes things, doesn't make a big deal about it.

"You okay?" he asked, not looking at me. Focusing on the machine.

"I don't know? People kept telling me things. Heavy things. And I just stood there and made coffee and apparently that was helpful but I don't understand how. I didn't DO anything."

"You listened."

"That's not doing anything."

He looked up then. "Yeah, it is."

I sat there on my counter—feet dangling like a kid because I'm short and counters are tall—and thought about that.

"People are starving for it," Todd said, going back to Betsy's maintenance. "Someone who just listens. Doesn't judge. Doesn't try to fix everything. Just... shows up and cares."

"I don't know how to fix anything," I said. "Margaret's daughter has purple hair and I don't know if that's a cry for help or normal teenage rebellion. Jordan's changing his major and maybe his dad will disown him. That businessman might quit his job and destroy his whole life. Mrs. Chen is lonely and I can't bring her husband back."

"You're not supposed to fix it."

"Then what am I supposed to do?"

"What you did. Listen. Care. Make really good coffee."

I laughed. It came out kind of broken. "The coffee I can do."

"The listening too." Todd finished with Betsy, wiped his hands on a rag. "You just don't see it yet."

After he left, I made myself a decaf—because it was 7 PM and I've learned that drinking regular coffee after 6 means I'll be awake until 2 AM quoting Romans 8:1 into the darkness and questioning all my life choices.³

I sat at the corner table. Kate's table. The one with the good light.

And I thought about all of them. The mom and the student and the businessman and the widow. All these people who sat in my chaotic little coffee shop and trusted me with their heaviest things.

I didn't solve anything.

Didn't quote the right Scripture or offer brilliant wisdom or even say particularly profound things.

I just made coffee. And listened. And let them be human in front of me without flinching.

Maybe that's the whole thing.

Maybe The Hot Mess was never really about the coffee at all—though the coffee IS excellent, let's be clear about that. Maybe it's about creating a space where people can be messy and lost and struggling and someone will still show up. Still care. Still make them a refill without judgment.

I spent so many years trying to say the right thing. Quote the right verse. Be helpful in the right way. Perform righteousness correctly.

Maybe people don't need performance.

Maybe they just need presence.

I sat there in my own coffee shop, surrounded by empty cups and mismatched furniture and the smell of espresso and possibility, and felt something shift. Like understanding settling into my bones.

The businessman left lighter. The mom left calmer. The student left with clarity.

All I did was show up.

And apparently, sometimes, that's everything.

I finished my decaf. Washed the cup. Turned off the lights. Locked the door behind me.

Tomorrow's Sunday. The shop is closed. I'll go to church, probably sit in the back, maybe knock over a hymnal or trip on absolutely nothing.

But Monday I'll be back. Making coffee. Listening. Showing up.

Being present while people feel heard.

Turns out that's not nothing.

It might actually be everything.

¹ I've tried to explain to her that there are lactose-free milk alternatives that actually taste good—the oat milk I use has a natural sweetness that complements espresso really well, and the protein structure creates microfoam that's almost identical to dairy—but then I realize I'm info-dumping about milk science and stop myself. Usually.

² Saturdays are chaos. Beautiful, exhausting chaos. Like if a hurricane and a family reunion had a baby and that baby served coffee.

³ "There is therefore NOW no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." I've quoted it to myself 847 times since leaving home. Possibly more. I stopped counting around month six.
