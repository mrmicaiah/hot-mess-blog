A Facebook group. For moms. Specifically for moms who are tired of being told to "cherish every moment" while they're running on four hours of sleep and cold coffee and the kind of adrenaline that only comes from stepping on a Lego at 6 AM.[^1]

It's called Moms Off the Hook.

I told her it was a great name and then I knocked over my entire display of to-go cups because I was gesturing too enthusiastically. She didn't even flinch. That's how you know she's good people.

Here's the thing about Irene: she gives permission.

Not the "treat yourself" kind that costs $47 and comes in a subscription box. The real kind. Permission to rest. To not enjoy every moment. To serve cereal for dinner and call it done.

She's writing a devotional for moms who don't have time for daily devotionals—which, yes, is beautifully ironic—and this group is where she's gathering her people before it launches.

If you're a mom.

If you're tired.

If you need someone to say "you're allowed to sit down" without the guilt trip that usually follows...

Go join: [Moms off the Hook Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/856640597344404)

Tell her Rena sent you.[^2]

[^1]: I don't have children. But I've stepped on enough espresso machine parts at 5 AM to understand the concept.

[^2]: She'll probably ask what one thing you need permission to let go of. Answer honestly. She actually reads them.
