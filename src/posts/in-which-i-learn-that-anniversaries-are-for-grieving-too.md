I woke up crying this morning and I don't know why.

That's a lie. I know exactly why. I just don't want to admit it.

One year ago today, I drove away from my parents' house with everything I owned crammed into a Honda Civic that smelled like anxiety and biscuits Mom made but refused to hand me directly. One year ago today, I watched that house get smaller in my rearview mirror while tears ran down my face and I quoted Romans 8:1 approximately forty-seven times before I hit the highway.

One year.

I made it one year.

I should feel triumphant. Victorious. Like one of those movie moments where the protagonist stands on top of a mountain with inspirational music swelling and maybe some wind blowing their hair in a photogenic way. I should feel like I WON.

Instead, I woke up at 5:47 AM with tears already on my pillow, and my first coherent thought was: *I miss my mom.*

Which is ridiculous. My mom isn't speaking to me. My mom communicates exclusively through passive-aggressive dish towels with Bible verses on them and long silences that somehow manage to be louder than actual yelling. My mom looked at my jeans last Christmas like I'd personally insulted Jesus.

But I miss her anyway.

I miss the version of her I wished I had. The version that existed in small moments—the cozy chair she sent when I moved in, the basket of kitchen essentials, the way she used to brush my hair when I was little before everything got complicated with rules and silence and disappointment.

I lay in bed for twenty minutes, crying into my pillow, trying to figure out what was WRONG with me. This was supposed to be a celebration. This was supposed to be the day I looked back and thought *look how far I've come* and maybe treated myself to something nice and felt GOOD about the person I'd become.

Instead I felt like someone had reached into my chest and squeezed.

The Hot Mess doesn't care about my emotional crisis. The Hot Mess needs to open at 7 AM whether or not I've gotten myself together, because rent doesn't pay itself and Jack and Becky Coleman believed in me enough to give me this chance, and I will NOT let them down just because I woke up inexplicably devastated on what should be a happy anniversary.

So I got up. I washed my face. I put on jeans—MY jeans, the ones I bought myself, the ones that still feel like rebellion and freedom every single time I wear them—and I walked downstairs to open the shop.

Betsy was waiting for me. Betsy is my espresso machine. She's temperamental and occasionally leaks and once staged what I can only describe as a full mechanical rebellion when Todd didn't show up for her monthly maintenance on time, but she's mine.[^1]

"Good morning," I said to her, because I talk to my equipment and I'm not going to apologize for it. "Please be nice to me today. I'm having... a day."

Betsy said nothing, because she's a machine. But I swear she hummed a little when I turned her on. Maybe that was solidarity. Maybe that was the heating element doing its job. Same thing, probably.

I went through my opening routine. Ground the beans—Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Riverside Coffee Roasting, my favorite, the one with the floral notes that smell like jasmine and new beginnings. Prepped the pastry case. Wiped down the counter. Swept the floor even though I'd swept it last night because there are always coffee grounds somewhere. Always. I found some behind the register once that I'm pretty sure had been there since the Mesozoic era.

The first customer came in at 7:03. Regular. Will—mid-fifties, works at the insurance office down the street, always gets a large dark roast with room for cream.

"Morning, Rena," he said.

"Morning!" I said, too brightly. Overcompensating. My voice did that thing where it goes up an octave and sounds like I'm auditioning for a commercial about breakfast cereal.

I reached for the large cup.

Knocked over the entire stack of medium cups instead.

They scattered across the counter like they were fleeing a crime scene. Several rolled onto the floor. One, inexplicably, ended up in the pastry case. I have no idea how. Physics doesn't explain my life anymore.

"I'm so sorry," I said, scrambling to pick them up. "I'm just—it's a—there's a thing—"

"No rush," Will said, because Will is a saint and has witnessed approximately forty-seven of my disasters in the past year without ever once commenting on them.

I got him his coffee. Only spilled a little. Only on myself.

The day went downhill from there.

By 10 AM, I had:

Spilled three drinks. One on a customer's newspaper, for which I apologized so profusely that she finally said "Honey, it's FINE, it was yesterday's paper anyway" in a tone that suggested I was making it weirder by continuing to apologize.

Burned myself twice. Once on the steam wand (rookie mistake, I KNOW better) and once on the edge of a cup I'd just pulled from the machine (less rookie, but equally stupid).

Dropped an entire bag of coffee beans. Not the big disaster—the small bags, the retail ones we sell—but still. Beans everywhere. In my shoes. Under the counter. Rolling across the floor like tiny caffeinated escape artists.

And cried in the bathroom. Twice.

The first time was quick—in and out, splash water on face, pretend everything's fine. The second time took longer because I couldn't stop and I didn't know WHY I couldn't stop and that made it worse.

I sat on the closed toilet lid in my tiny bathroom—the one that's really more of a closet with plumbing—and I pressed my hands against my eyes and thought: *What is WRONG with me?*

I made it. I made it ONE YEAR. The shop is still open. I'm still paying rent. I haven't crawled back home in defeat. I haven't had to wear a jean skirt in twelve months. I have FRIENDS now—plural, more than just Jennifer—and a church that doesn't make me feel small and a life that's actually MINE.

I won.

So why did winning feel like losing?

The lunch rush—if you can call three customers a rush, which in The Hot Mess economy, you absolutely can—came and went. I made drinks. I smiled. I said "Have a great day!" in my fake-cheerful voice so many times that the words stopped meaning anything.

By 2 PM, the shop was empty.

I should have used the quiet to restock. To clean. To do any of the forty-seven things on my perpetual to-do list that never seems to get shorter no matter how many items I check off.

Instead, I walked into the back room—the one that's really just a glorified storage closet with a folding chair and my extra supplies—and I sat down on an overturned milk crate and I put my head in my hands.

And I just... let it happen.

The crying I'd been fighting all day. The weight in my chest that had been pressing down since I woke up. The thing I couldn't name and couldn't explain and couldn't make STOP.

I sat there in my apron—stained now, coffee and milk and one smear of something that might be chocolate syrup—and I cried. Ugly crying. The kind where your nose runs and your face gets blotchy and you make sounds that aren't quite sobs and aren't quite anything else.

I don't know how long I was there. Long enough that my legs started to cramp from sitting on a milk crate. Long enough that the afternoon light shifted through the tiny window. Long enough that I'd given up trying to stop and just surrendered to whatever this was.

That's when Jennifer found me.

---

"Rena? Hey, are you back—oh."

She stopped in the doorway. I looked up, face a mess, apron a mess, everything a mess.

"Hi," I said, or tried to say. It came out more like a croak.

Jennifer didn't ask what happened. She didn't panic. She just grabbed another overturned crate, dragged it next to mine, and sat down. Her shoulder touched my shoulder. Warm and solid and present.

"What's wrong?" she asked. Not demanding. Just gentle.

"I don't know," I said. And then, because that wasn't quite true: "I mean. I know. Sort of. It's just—today is—I moved out a year ago today."

I waited for her to say congratulations. To tell me how great I was doing. To launch into Jennifer-mode, which involves enthusiasm and encouragement and usually at least one suggestion that I'm not giving myself enough credit.

Instead she was quiet for a long moment. Then she said: "Anniversaries are hard."

"They shouldn't be." I wiped my nose on my sleeve, which was disgusting, but we were past dignified at this point. "I should be HAPPY. I made it a whole year. The shop is open. I'm wearing jeans right now, Jennifer. JEANS. In PUBLIC. That's—that's everything I wanted."

"Yeah," she said. "It is."

"So why do I feel like this?" My voice cracked. "Why do I feel like something died?"

Jennifer turned to look at me. Her perfectly tousled blonde hair and her concerned expression and her trendy jeans—the ones Mom would call tight but really aren't—and her absolute refusal to give me a platitude.

"Because something did die," she said. "Maybe. Or... not died. But something ended. Something changed forever."

"I WANTED it to change."

"I know."

"I prayed about it. I felt God leading me. I did everything RIGHT."

"I know."

"Then WHY—"

I couldn't finish. The crying started again. Jennifer put her arm around me and let me cry on her shoulder, which was going to ruin her shirt, but she didn't seem to care.

When I finally calmed down enough to speak again, she said something I'll never forget.

"Rena. You're grieving."

I pulled back. "Grieving what? I chose this. Nobody died. Nothing bad happened. I'm exactly where I wanted to be."

"You're grieving what you lost," she said. "And what you never had. And what you wished you had. You're grieving the family dinners that won't be the same anymore. The relationship with your mom that was always complicated and is now more complicated. The version of your life where you got to have freedom AND easy family stuff at the same time." She paused. "You can grieve what you gained and what you lost at the same time. That's not contradiction. That's just being human."

I stared at her.

"I'm allowed to be sad about this?"

"You're allowed to feel whatever you feel." She squeezed my shoulder. "You can celebrate the jeans and mourn the family dinners. You can be proud of the shop and miss your mom. You can be FREE and still wish freedom hadn't cost so much. Those aren't opposites. They're just... all true at once."

---

I thought about that for a long time after she said it.

All true at once.

I thought about my dad. His quiet texts. The picture of biscuits with no context. The way he helped me move furniture but gave me that look when he saw me in jeans for the first time—that look that said *I love you but I don't recognize you* and *I'm proud of you but I'm also disappointed* and *I support you but I have limits.*[^2]

I thought about my mom. The silent treatment. The dish towels with Bible verses. The cozy chair she sent—the one perfect for curling up with a book—even though she wasn't speaking to me. The way she knows how I like my eggs but doesn't know how to say she misses me. The way I know she loves me even when her love looks like disapproval.

I thought about the family dinners I'll never have the same way again. The holidays that will always be complicated now. The distance between who I was raised to be and who I've chosen to become.

Freedom came with loss.

Both things are true.

I'd been so focused on celebrating the freedom that I'd forgotten to mourn the loss. Or maybe I'd thought mourning the loss meant I regretted the choice. Like if I cried about missing my parents, I was somehow saying I shouldn't have left.

But that's not how grief works.

You can celebrate what you chose and still grieve what it cost. You can be grateful for the life you're building and still miss the life you left behind. You can know you made the right decision and still feel the ache of everything that decision changed.

That's not weakness. That's not regret.

That's just being honest about being human.

"I think," I said finally, wiping my face with a paper towel Jennifer had found somewhere, "I need to close early."

"Yeah?"

"And eat ice cream."

Jennifer nodded solemnly. "That sounds medically necessary."

"And watch a terrible movie."

"I know just the one."

"And not talk about feelings anymore today."

"Done." She stood up, offered me her hand. "I'll drive. You're a mess."

"I'm THE Hot Mess," I said, gesturing weakly at my disaster of an apron. "It's aspirational."

She laughed. I almost laughed. Close enough.

---

We closed the shop an hour early. I put a sign in the window—"Closed for Personal Emergency"—which felt dramatic but also true. An emotional crisis counts as an emergency. I've decided.

Jennifer drove us to the grocery store. We bought two pints of ice cream. I got chocolate chip cookie dough because that's what I always get when life feels overwhelming. Jennifer got mint chocolate chip because Jennifer makes choices I don't understand but support anyway.

We went back to my apartment—the one above the shop, the one that's been mine for exactly one year, the one where I'm allowed to wear jeans and drink coffee at 3 AM and watch movies with swear words and exist exactly as I am.

We sat on my couch. We ate our ice cream directly from the containers, because we're adults and that's allowed. We watched a terrible movie about a woman who falls in love with a baker even though she's engaged to a businessman, and the whole thing was predictable and poorly written and exactly what I needed.

We didn't talk about feelings.

We didn't talk about my parents.

We didn't talk about grief or freedom or the complicated mathematics of trading one kind of loss for another kind of gain.

We just sat there. Two friends. Ice cream. Bad movie. The apartment quiet and safe and mine.

Sometimes that's the best way to honor an anniversary. Acknowledging it hurt. Letting yourself be human about it. Not trying to perform triumph when what you actually feel is tender.

---

After Jennifer left—after the movie and the ice cream and the comfortable silence—I sat alone in my apartment.

One year.

I looked around at the space I'd built. The walls I'd painted. The cozy chair Mom sent, the one that still smells faintly like her house if I bury my face in it just right. The coffee maker on my counter—a good one, not Betsy, just for me. The books on my shelf. The jeans hanging in my closet.

All of it mine. All of it chosen. All of it hard-won.

And all of it came at a cost.

There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.[^3]

I said it out loud, like I always do when I need to remember. The verse that started everything. The verse that taught me God's love isn't about rules and condemnation and earning my way into His good graces. The verse that gave me permission to question and seek and ultimately leave.

No condemnation.

Not for wearing jeans. Not for wanting freedom. Not for leaving home. Not for grieving what I lost even while celebrating what I gained.

No condemnation for being human. For feeling all of it at once. For celebrating and mourning in the same breath.

Maybe that's what grace really looks like. Not the absence of complicated feelings, but permission to have them. All of them. Without having to pick just one.

---

I went to bed that night still feeling tender. Still feeling the ache of the anniversary. Still missing my mom in ways that don't make logical sense and don't need to.

But I also felt something else.

Something like peace. Like permission. Like maybe the weight I'd been carrying all day wasn't a sign that I'd done something wrong, but a sign that I'd done something real. Something costly. Something worth grieving AND worth celebrating.

One year.

I made it one year.

Not because I figured everything out. Not because I stopped being a mess. Not because I somehow transcended the complicated feelings and achieved enlightenment.

Just because I kept going. One day at a time. One spilled drink at a time. One tear at a time. One Romans 8:1 at a time.

That's what freedom looks like, I'm learning.

Not triumph without pain. Not victory without cost. Not celebration without grief.

Just the freedom to feel all of it. To hold the joy and the sorrow in the same hands. To acknowledge that leaving was the right thing AND the hard thing, and those aren't opposites.

They're just both true.

And I'm allowed to live in the both.

---

Tomorrow I'll open the shop again. I'll make coffee. I'll probably spill something. I'll definitely knock something over. I'll quote Romans 8:1 at least twelve times before noon.

But today—today I let myself grieve.

And maybe that's part of growing too.

Happy anniversary to everyone who's made it through something hard. Who's celebrating something that cost them more than they expected. Who's wondering why triumph doesn't feel like the movies said it would.

You're allowed to feel all of it.

That's not contradiction.

That's just being human.
