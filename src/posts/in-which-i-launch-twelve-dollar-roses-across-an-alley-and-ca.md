I hear it through the wall at 2:15 on a Friday — or rather, I don't hear it. What I hear is the absence of the hum that's been there since Jamie moved into Petal & Vine eight months ago, the low mechanical drone of her walk-in cooler that I've gotten so used to it's become part of the shop's ambient noise, like the radiator and the piano hymns and the sound of my own voice explaining coffee to people who didn't ask. The hum stops. The wall goes quiet. And then — nothing.

No crash. No yelling. No Jamie-shaped commotion.

Just nothing.

Which is how I know something is really wrong, because Jamie is like me in one critical way — we are both women who took over businesses we are barely qualified to run and are holding them together with optimism and stubbornness and an unwillingness to admit we're drowning. But we're different in one critical way too: when things go wrong, I go loud. I spiral, I over-explain, I knock things over while narrating the disaster in real time. Jamie goes quiet. Jamie folds inward. Jamie stands in the wreckage and says nothing, which is worse, because silence is harder to help.

I give it five minutes. Then I go through the back room, out the alley door, and knock on Jamie's back entrance, which is propped open with a cinderblock despite the fact that it's February and twenty-nine degrees, which tells me the situation is worse than I thought because Jamie does not prop doors open in winter unless she's already past the point of caring about her heating bill.

She's standing in the middle of Petal & Vine's back workroom staring at the walk-in cooler the way you stare at someone who's just said something unforgivable. Arms at her sides. Face blank. The cooler door is open. The light inside is off. The hum is gone. And inside that cooler — I can see from the doorway — are rows and rows of roses and peonies and eucalyptus, the Morrison wedding order for Sunday, two hundred and forty dollars of flowers that are, as of right now, slowly warming toward death.[^1]

"Jamie."

She doesn't look at me.

"Jamie. How long has it been off?"

"Twenty minutes." Her voice is flat. "Maybe thirty. I was in the front doing a consultation and I didn't — I should have —" She stops. Starts again. "It's the Morrison wedding. Sunday. Carrie Morrison has called me eleven times this week. Eleven. She has opinions about eucalyptus placement, Rena. She has a *Pinterest board*."

"Okay. Okay, we can —"

"The compressor is dead. I can hear it. That click-and-nothing sound. My aunt warned me about this. She said the cooler was 'temperamental,' which is what people say about equipment when they mean 'this will fail at the worst possible moment and cost you everything.'"

She's still not looking at me. She's looking at the roses. They're beautiful — deep red, tight buds, the kind that open slow over days if they're kept cold. If.

"I have a deep freeze," I say.

Now she looks at me.

"In my back room. It's big. It's cold. It currently contains frozen croissants and a bag of scones I'm pretending don't exist, but there's room. Probably. If we rearrange."

"Rena, those are flowers. You can't just —"

"We wrap the stems. Damp towels. Keep them upright if we can. It's not a cooler but it's cold and it's ten steps through the alley and it's better than watching two hundred dollars of roses turn into potpourri."

Jamie stares at me. I can see her calculating — the risk, the logistics, the dignity of accepting help from the neighboring coffee shop owner who once crashed into her mailbox during a snowstorm. I can see the exact moment she decides that dignity is a luxury she can't afford today.

"Okay," she says. "Okay. Yes."

What follows is — and I want to be precise about this — chaos.

Not the fun kind. Not the kind where you look back and laugh and post about it on social media with a cute caption. The kind where two women who are both operating on adrenaline and limited spatial reasoning attempt to transport approximately forty buckets of flowers through a narrow alley in February while the wind is doing something hostile and the ground is doing something slippery and neither of us has thought to put on a coat.

The first three trips go fine. Relatively. I carry a bucket of peonies without incident, which feels like a personal victory and which I celebrate internally because celebrating externally would involve taking my focus off the bucket, and we all know what happens when I take my focus off things I'm carrying.

The fourth trip is roses. Two dozen long-stems in a white plastic bucket, heavy with water, the stems thorny in a way that I am learning in real time as they press against my forearms. I'm in the alley. The ground is that particular February surface — not ice exactly, but the memory of ice, the ghost of last week's freeze still embedded in the concrete, slick in places you don't expect.

My left foot finds one of those places.

The bucket doesn't fall. I want to emphasize that — I do not drop the roses. What happens is more complex and more spectacular: I slip, catch myself with my right foot, overcorrect, the bucket tips, I pull it back, the water sloshes, my elbow hits the alley wall, and the bucket — in what I can only describe as a moment of structural betrayal — tips forward and launches approximately two dozen red roses across the frozen alley like the world's most romantic yard sale.

I'm on my hands and knees. Roses everywhere. On the concrete, against the wall, one somehow on top of the dumpster. The thorns have made their opinions about my forearms known. The water from the bucket is soaking through my jeans, which is — I am handling this. I am not handling this.

Jamie appears at her back door. Looks at me. Looks at the roses. Looks at me again.

And laughs.

Not a polite laugh. Not a stressed-out exhale. A real laugh — open, surprised, the kind that sounds like it's been stuck somewhere for months and just found the exit. She's leaning against the doorframe laughing in a way that makes her look like a different person, like the version of herself that existed before she inherited a failing florist from an aunt who described a dying cooler as "temperamental."

"Are you — are you okay?" she manages.

"I am HELPING," I shout from the ground, which makes her laugh harder, and then I'm laughing too, on my hands and knees in a frozen alley surrounded by roses that cost twelve dollars a stem, and this is probably not what Ecclesiastes meant but it's close.

We pick them up together. Every stem. On our hands and knees in the alley, fingers numb, checking each one for damage, and most of them are fine because roses are tougher than they look — which is maybe a metaphor but I'm too cold to develop it.

Earl appears at his back door. Because of course he does. Earl has a sixth sense for neighborhood events, honed over decades of being the man who sees everything from his shop window and has opinions about all of it.

"In 1953," he says, leaning against the frame with his coffee, "the florist on this block kept her overflow stock in the church basement. Just so you know."

"Thank you, Earl."

"The church had better humidity. Basements usually do. Something about the stone."

"Earl. Thank you."

He nods. Doesn't offer to help carry anything. Does hold the door open, which for Earl is practically manual labor.

By 3:30 we have most of the flowers in my deep freeze, crammed between frozen croissants and a box of scone mix I forgot I had. The deep freeze smells like a florist having a breakdown in a bakery, which is essentially what's happened.

Todd arrives at 3:45 because I texted him. He looks at the cooler. Looks at the compressor. Says, "Yep." Tells Jamie he can get a part by tomorrow morning. "Should be fine," he says. Jamie's face tightens. Todd means it. Jamie's not there yet.

Todd leaves. Lou, who has been watching from across the street with the quiet satisfaction of a man who finds this block endlessly entertaining, goes back inside.[^2]

Jamie and I end up on my back room floor. My spot — the one in front of the deep freeze where I slide down the wall and hug my knees when I need a moment. Except now there are two of us, side by side, backs against the wall, the deep freeze humming behind us full of flowers and frozen pastry, and the room smells like eucalyptus and cold and the particular exhaustion of two people who just refused to let the afternoon win.

"I almost called my aunt," Jamie says. "When the cooler died. My first thought was to call her and ask what to do."

"What stopped you?"

"She'd tell me to figure it out. That's what she always said. 'You're the owner now, Jamie. Figure it out.'" She pauses. "I didn't figure it out. You showed up."

"I showed up with zero plan and knocked your roses across an alley."

"Yeah." She almost smiles. "But you showed up."

I make her a flat white. She's never had one — "I don't really do coffee," she says, which is something I choose to hear as "I haven't met the right coffee yet" because I am an optimist about exactly one thing in this world and it is coffee. Microfoam, smooth, the Guatemalan because it's chocolatey and warm and she needs something that tastes like things working out. She holds it with both hands the way people hold their first real coffee — careful, curious, surprised.

"This is really good," she says.

"I know."

She looks at me. I look at her. Two women on a back room floor, one of us covered in rose scratches, both of us in wet jeans, a deep freeze full of someone else's wedding flowers humming behind our heads.

Two are better than one, the verse says. Because if either of them falls down — literally, on ice, in an alley, with roses — one can help the other up.

Or at least sit next to her on the floor afterward and make her first flat white and not say anything about the fact that they're both figuring it out as they go.

The deep freeze hums. The eucalyptus smells like someone's trying to tell us something.

Jamie finishes the flat white. Sets it down.

"Same time tomorrow?" she says. "In case Todd needs help with the cooler?"

"I'll be here."

"Rena?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for hearing the wall go quiet."

I don't say anything. I just sit there, on my floor, next to my neighbor, with rose petals stuck to my jeans and eucalyptus in my hair and the faint smell of frozen scones I'll never admit to owning.

The block is a strange place. But it's ours.
