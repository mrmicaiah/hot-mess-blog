I wake up at 5:14 AM, which is sixteen minutes before my alarm, which means my body has decided that sleep is a suggestion it's no longer willing to follow. This has been happening for nine days. I know it's nine because I've been counting, and I've been counting because counting is what I do when I can't control something — I quantify it, as if turning insomnia into data makes it less like drowning and more like research.

The apartment is dark. Mabel is a warm weight at the foot of the bed, curled into the quilt Mom made when I was twelve, and I lie there for a minute listening to her breathe because one of us should be sleeping and it might as well be the cat. Through the window, St. Francis Memorial is a darker shape against the dark sky, its steeple just barely visible, patient the way stone is patient — not because it chose to be but because it doesn't know how to be anything else.

I get up. I don't turn on the overhead light because the overhead light at 5:14 AM is an act of violence against the human spirit, so I use the bathroom light with the door cracked, which casts everything in a yellow stripe that makes the apartment look like a Vermeer painting if Vermeer painted women in oversized t-shirts with hair that has achieved a state of entropy usually reserved for physics experiments.

Coffee first. Always coffee first. I pull on jeans and the sweater with the coffee stain that I've now officially promoted from accident to accessory, and I go downstairs through the back room, past the deep freeze, into the shop. Betsy is cold and quiet, waiting. The chairs are still up on the tables from last night. The shop smells like wood and yesterday's coffee and something faintly sweet that's either the old bakery walls remembering what they used to be or my imagination filling in gaps because I'm tired enough to hallucinate pastry.

I start the routine. Grinder, Betsy, wiping down the counter, restocking cups — my body knows this dance even when my brain has left the building, and my brain has been leaving the building a lot lately. Nine months of opening and closing and smiling at every customer and meaning it, mostly, but the smiling takes more energy than it should, and the energy has to come from somewhere, and lately it's been sending invoices I can't cover.

I'm fine. I want to be clear about that. I'm fine.[^1]

At 5:38 I go back upstairs to get Noah's coffee ready.

This is the ritual. Every morning for seven months — two hundred and twenty-something cups now, I've lost the exact count, which bothers me more than it should — I make Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, light roast, and set it outside his door. He never says thank you. The cups are always empty. This is our language, and it's the most fluent conversation I have most days.

His wife's wooden scoop is where it always is, next to Betsy, on the shelf with the things that matter — the laminated coffee sleeve, the cemetery stone, Lily's daisy mug with the thumbprint in the glaze. I pick it up and the wood is smooth and warm in a way that has nothing to do with temperature and everything to do with how many hands have held it before mine. His wife's hands. Then his. Now mine. There's a word for objects that carry more weight than their material accounts for, and I don't know what it is, but this scoop is that.

I measure the beans. I take my time with the bloom — the hot water hitting the grounds, the way they swell and release gas, thirty seconds of patience that I am almost never good at but here, with this, I am — and then the slow pour. Concentric circles. The kitchen fills with it: floral, jasmine, something almost like stone fruit if you're paying attention, and I'm always paying attention to this, even when I'm paying attention to nothing else.

I carry the cup upstairs. The hallway is dim, the overhead bulb doing its usual impression of a light source that has given up on its purpose but hasn't been formally relieved of duty. Noah's door is closed. The empty cup from yesterday is outside it, placed exactly where it always is — centered on the small mat, handle turned left.

But today there's something underneath it.

A note. Folded once. Torn from something — a legal pad, maybe, the yellow kind with the blue lines. His handwriting is shaky in the way that old hands make handwriting shaky, not from uncertainty but from the simple physics of a body that has been holding pens for eighty-some years and has earned the right to tremble.

Four words:

*You look tired lately.*

I stand in the hallway holding the note in one hand and the fresh cup in the other and I don't know what to do with either of them, which is a sentence that could describe most of my life but feels especially accurate at 5:41 AM in a dim hallway with jasmine-scented steam rising between my fingers.

He noticed.

Two hundred and twenty-something mornings, and I thought the transaction was one-directional — I give, he receives, we don't discuss it, the cups appear and disappear like some kind of caffeine-based tide governed by forces neither of us names. But he was watching. Not the way people watch when they want something from you, not the way my mother watches — cataloguing failures, measuring hemlines, tracking the distance between who you are and who you should be. He was watching the way you watch someone you've decided to care about. Quietly. Without agenda. The way you notice a light flickering before anyone else sees it's about to go out.

I set his fresh cup down. I pick up the empty one. I hold the note.

And then I do something I didn't plan, which is most of the things I do, but this one surprises even me: I sit down.

Right there. On the hallway floor. Back against the wall, knees up, the empty cup beside me and the note in my lap and the faint sound of Betsy humming downstairs because I left her on, which I shouldn't have, which is fine, which is a problem for future Rena who will deal with it in approximately however long it takes present Rena to stop sitting on this floor.

The hallway is not comfortable. The floor is old hardwood that creaks when you look at it wrong, and the baseboard has a chip in it shaped like Ohio, and there is a draft coming from somewhere that I should probably mention to Pastor Coleman since he owns the building, but right now none of that matters because I am sitting on a floor at 5:43 AM holding a note that says *You look tired lately* and something behind my sternum is coming loose in a way that feels less like breaking and more like — exhaling. Like I've been holding a breath I didn't know I was holding.

My eyes are wet. This is embarrassing. I'm crying in a hallway because an elderly man who has spoken approximately nineteen words to me in seven months noticed that I'm tired. This is disproportionate. This is an overreaction. This is what happens when you run on empty long enough that a single act of seeing undoes you — four words on a legal pad, and the whole infrastructure of *I'm fine* just quietly buckles.[^2]

The door opens.

Noah stands there in a flannel robe and slippers that have seen better decades, and he looks down at me on his hallway floor with an expression that contains neither surprise nor judgment, just the calm assessment of a man who has lived long enough to understand that sometimes people end up on floors.

"I brought your coffee," I say, which is absurd because the coffee is on his mat and I am on his floor and my face is wet and there is absolutely no version of this that looks normal.

He looks at the cup. Looks at me. Picks up the cup.

Then he sits down.

Right there. Next to me. An eighty-something man in a flannel robe lowering himself to a hallway floor with the careful deliberation of someone whose knees have opinions about this decision, and he doesn't say anything, just settles against the wall beside me with about a foot of space between us and drinks his coffee.

The hallway is quiet. Betsy hums downstairs. Somewhere outside, a truck passes on Main Street — early delivery, probably, the bread truck that comes before six. The draft from the baseboard moves across my ankles. Noah drinks. I sit. Neither of us speaks.

It lasts maybe three minutes. Maybe five. Time does something strange when you stop trying to manage it — it stops being a resource you're spending and starts being a place you're in. I am in a hallway. There is a man beside me drinking coffee I made from his dead wife's scoop. My eyes are drying. The light through the hallway window is turning from black to the thin gray that means February is thinking about morning but isn't committed yet.

Noah finishes his coffee. He sets the cup down between us, and I see it — the cup is empty, and at the bottom, in the residue, there's nothing. No smiley face. That's Walter's thing. Noah doesn't leave messages. Noah just leaves absence where the coffee was, and somehow that's enough.

He puts one hand on the wall and pushes himself up with the slow dignity of a man who sat on a floor for someone and is now dealing with the consequences. I should help him. I don't. He wouldn't want me to, and I know this the way I know his blend and his silence and the handle turned left.

He looks down at me.

"Go open your shop," he says.

That's it. Three more words. He picks up his cup, turns, and closes the door.

I sit there for another thirty seconds. The note is still in my lap. *You look tired lately.* Not a question. Not advice. Not *you should rest* or *take a day off* or *have you tried melatonin.* Just an observation from someone who was paying attention, delivered on a legal pad, requiring nothing in return.

I fold the note and put it in my pocket. I stand up. My knees crack, which is a sound I'm choosing not to think about at twenty-nine. I go downstairs. Betsy is fine — she's been running hot but she's always running a little hot, that's just Betsy, she has moods.

I open the shop. I turn on the piano hymns. I unlock the front door and the bell rings when I test it, the same small bright sound it makes a hundred times a day, and the February light comes through the front window gray and thin and completely uninterested in being beautiful, which I respect.

The first customer comes at 6:22. I make their latte. I smile. I mean it.

I'm still tired. That didn't change. Noah sitting on the floor didn't fix the nine nights of not sleeping or the accumulation or the place where the energy used to live. But something shifted — not the tiredness itself but my relationship to it, the way you can carry something heavy for a long time and then someone sees you carrying it and it doesn't get lighter but you stand up straighter because you're not carrying it alone anymore, even if the other person never touches it, even if all they do is sit next to you on a floor and drink their coffee and say *go open your shop* like it's the simplest thing in the world.

Rest isn't always sleep.

Sometimes it's just being known.

[^2]: Two hundred and twenty-something cups. He was counting too. Or he was watching. I don't know which is more undoing.
