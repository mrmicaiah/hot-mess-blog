I've remade this cappuccino four times.

FOUR TIMES.

The Instagram DM arrived at 6:47 AM yesterday: "Hi! I'm Ruby Freshly, food blogger at @ChicagoBitesAndSips. I'll be in the area tomorrow and would love to stop by The Hot Mess for a review. No pressure! Just want to try your coffee. ♥️"

No pressure.

NO PRESSURE.

She has 50,000 followers.[^1] That's 50,000 people who will read whatever she writes about my coffee shop. 50,000 potential customers or 50,000 people who will know I'm a disaster pretending to run a business.

I've been scrubbing the same spot on the counter for ten minutes. It's already clean. I cleaned it at 5 AM. And again at 6. The entire shop smells like lemon disinfectant and my anxiety, which honestly might be the same smell.

"You're spiraling," Jennifer said when she video-called at 7:30 AM. She was already perfectly put-together, wearing a sweater that probably cost more than my monthly utility bill. "Just be yourself!"

"WHAT IF MYSELF ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH?" I may have yelled this. The couple at the corner table looked up from their laptops.

"Rena." Jennifer's voice went soft. "Your coffee is incredible. You've been practicing since you were ten. You've got this."

Except Jennifer doesn't understand that knowledge and practice don't matter when your brain is screaming and your hands are shaking and you're convinced that this—THIS—is the moment everything falls apart. This is the moment everyone discovers you're a fraud. A hot mess making hot coffee, except what if the coffee isn't even that good and you've been delusional this whole time and—

Romans 8:1. "There is therefore NOW no condemnation."

I've said it fourteen times this morning. It's 9:15 AM.

---

The bell above the door chimes at 10:37 AM.

I know it's her immediately. She looks exactly like her Instagram: sleek black hair, designer glasses, carrying a bag that probably costs more than Betsy. She's wearing white jeans.[^2] She's wearing WHITE JEANS to a coffee shop called THE HOT MESS.

This is a test. This is definitely a test.

"Hi!" My voice comes out too loud. "Welcome to The Hot Mess! I'm Rena, and I'll be—I mean, I'm the owner, so I'll be making your coffee, obviously, since I'm the only one here, which isn't a bad thing, just a small operation thing, very intentional, artisanal, one-on-one—"

I'm still talking. Why am I still talking.

"I'm Ruby!" She smiles, and it seems genuine, which somehow makes this worse. "I love the name. Very honest."

"It's—yes. Honest. That's—" I grab a menu that I've already memorized and handed her approximately six times in my head during my practice runs. "We have a seasonal lavender latte that's really popular, or if you prefer traditional, our cappuccino is—it's my favorite. The espresso is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, single-origin, roasted by Riverside Coffee Roasting about thirty minutes north, and the flavor profile has these beautiful floral notes that—"

I'm info-dumping. I'm info-dumping to a FOOD BLOGGER WITH 50,000 FOLLOWERS.

"The cappuccino sounds perfect," Ruby says, still smiling. "And maybe one of those croissants?"

The croissants. I pick them up fresh from André's Bakery every morning at 6 AM. They're perfect. Buttery, flaky, the kind that leave delicate crumbs on your fingers. I've selected the best one. I've been saving the best one for her.

I turn to grab it from the pastry case.

My elbow hits the edge of the case door.

The croissant launches itself into the air.

Time slows down. I watch it arc through space—this perfect, golden, buttery work of art—and land face-down on the floor.

On the floor I scrubbed four times this morning.

The floor that's clean but is still THE FLOOR.

"Oh no. Oh no no no no—" I'm already crouching, scooping it up, except now there's a hair on it (where did the HAIR come from?!) and it's definitely floor-croissant now and I can't serve floor-croissant to a food blogger—

"It's totally fine!" Ruby's voice floats down from above. "Happens all the time."

"It's NOT fine!" I'm standing now, holding the floor-croissant like evidence of my inadequacy. "I'll make you a fresh one. I mean, not MAKE one, I don't make them, André makes them, but I'll—I'll toast you a fresh one. Do you want it toasted? You didn't ask for it toasted but maybe toasted would be better and—"

I'm backing toward the kitchen area.

I'm still holding the floor-croissant.

I bump into the espresso machine.

My hand—the hand holding the floor-croissant—touches the steam wand.

The steam wand that's been running for the past hour because I was too anxious to turn it off between practice runs.

"OUCH!" I drop the croissant. Again. It lands in the sink. I'm cradling my hand, which is BURNING, and I can feel tears starting because of course I'm crying now, in front of Ruby Freshly and her 50,000 followers and her white jeans that are probably designer and—

"Oh my god, are you okay?" Ruby's suddenly behind the counter, which means she came around the counter without being invited, which means she's seen the chaos back here, the practice cappuccinos I dumped in the sink, the coffee grounds on my shoe[^3]—

"I'm fine! I'm totally fine!" I'm running cold water over my hand. "I'll have your cappuccino ready in just—I just need to—"

I turn to grab the espresso portafilter.

I've left it in the machine too long.

The shot's over-extracted. Bitter. Ruined.

"I'm so sorry," I'm saying, and I'm crying now, properly crying, tears running down my face while I try to dump the portafilter and reload it. "I'm so sorry, I'll remake it, I've made this exact cappuccino four hundred times, I promise I know what I'm doing—"

"Hey." Ruby's voice is soft. "Rena. It's okay."

"It's NOT okay!" The portafilter slips. Fresh grounds spray across the counter. "You came to review my coffee shop and I dropped your croissant and burned myself and now I'm standing here CRYING and getting grounds everywhere and—"

I grab the milk pitcher.

The milk pitcher that's sitting on the edge of the drip tray.

It tips.

Milk cascades across the counter.

Across the counter where Ruby's designer bag is sitting.

"NO!" I lunge for the bag, knock over my water glass in the process, and now there's milk AND water and Ruby's trying to help and I'm apologizing and crying and there are coffee grounds stuck to my wet hands and I think I'm having a panic attack and—

"Rena."

Ruby's hands are on my shoulders.

"Breathe," she says. "Just breathe."

---

I'm sitting on the floor behind the counter, wrapped hand throbbing, milk in my hair, watching Ruby Freshly—food blogger with 50,000 followers—wipe down her own bag with paper towels.

This is it. This is the moment my coffee shop dies before it really lives. This is the moment I have to go home and face Mother's silence and Dad's quiet disappointment and admit that Jennifer's business plan was built on hope and neither of us knew what we were doing.

"I'm so sorry," I whisper. "You came here for a review and I—I ruined everything."

Ruby looks up from her bag (which seems fine, thank God, or thank expensive leather, or both). "Can I be honest with you?"

I nod because what else can I do.

"I've been to forty-three coffee shops in the last two months." She sits down on the floor next to me. On the floor I scrubbed four times. "Every single one was Instagram-perfect. White subway tile, Edison bulbs, succulents in concrete planters. The baristas all looked like they'd stepped out of a catalog. Everything was curated within an inch of its life."

She pulls her knees up, wraps her arms around them.

"It was exhausting," she says. "All that perfection. You can't relax in perfection. You can't spill anything or laugh too loud or—or be human."

I'm staring at her, coffee grounds still on my shirt, confused.

"I dropped your croissant," I say, just to be clear.

"You did."

"And burned myself. And spilled milk on your bag. And I'm sitting on the floor crying."

"You are."

"So... this is the part where you write a scathing review?"

Ruby smiles. "This is the part where you make me that cappuccino you've been promising. Because I've been watching you this whole time, and you know what I noticed?"

I shake my head.

"Every time something went wrong—every single time—your first instinct was to fix it. Not to blame me for surprising you, not to make excuses. You tried to fix it. You CARED."

She stands up, offers me her hand.

"And that steam wand? The way you checked the temperature three times before the milk disaster? The way you threw out that shot because it was over-extracted? That's not someone who doesn't know what they're doing. That's someone who cares about every single detail."

I let her pull me up.

"Plus," she adds, "any coffee shop called The Hot Mess better live up to its name. Otherwise what's even the point?"

---

I make Ruby's cappuccino with my bandaged hand.

I don't practice first. I don't second-guess. I just... make it.

Pull the shot: twenty-five seconds, perfect honey-colored crema.

Steam the milk: 140°F, microfoam so silky it pours like cream.

Pour the art: a heart, simple and clean.

I hand it to Ruby. There are still coffee grounds on my shirt. My hair is milk-adjacent. I probably look like I've been through a war.

"Thank you," I say, and my voice only shakes a little. "For being kind. For—for staying."

Ruby takes a photo of the cappuccino. Then she looks up at me.

"Can I take your picture too?"

I must look terrified because she quickly adds: "You don't have to. But... I think my followers would love to see the person behind the coffee. The real person."

I think about saying no. I think about how I look—flour-dusted, tear-stained, catastrophically messy.

Then I think about the woman at Jennifer's church potluck. The one in jeans, crying over her plate, thanking God. Freedom and devotion in the same moment.

"Okay," I say.

Ruby lifts her phone. I'm standing behind the counter, bandaged hand resting on Betsy, coffee grounds visible on my shirt, probably flour in my hair.

"Could you—" Ruby pauses. "Could you explain why you named it The Hot Mess? I want to capture that."

So I tell her. About Jennifer and the brainstorming session. About perfect coffee in an imperfect world. About how I used to think I had to be perfect to be worthy of anything—love, approval, success, God's attention. About how I'm learning that maybe that was never true.

"Sometimes the best things come from the mess," I hear myself say. "Not despite it. Because of it. The mess is where we're honest. Where we're human. Where we're—"

I look around my shop. At the mismatched tables and the exposed brick and the sign Jennifer and I painted together. At the beautiful chaos of it all.

"Where we're real," I finish quietly.

Ruby's smiling behind her phone. She takes the photo.

She stays for an hour. We talk about coffee sourcing and her favorite roasters and she shows me photos from other shops she's reviewed. When she leaves, she insists on paying even though I try to comp it. She leaves a twenty-dollar tip on a six-dollar cappuccino.

At the door, she turns back.

"You're going to do great," she says. "Just... maybe keep some burn cream behind the counter?"

**Two days later**

I'm in my apartment—Jennifer's coming over later with Thai food—when my phone starts exploding.

First Jennifer: "OH MY GOD CHECK INSTAGRAM"

Then Todd: "Saw the review. Nice work. Called it."

Then approximately forty-seven notifications from Instagram.

I open the app with shaking hands.

@ChicagoBitesAndSips, posted two hours ago:

There's a photo of my cappuccino. Perfect heart, perfect microfoam, perfect crema.

And below it, a photo of me. Mid-explanation, hands gesturing, flour visible in my hair, coffee grounds on my shirt, eyes bright with something that might be tears or passion or both.

The caption reads:

> *"The Hot Mess lives up to its name, and I've never felt more welcome in a coffee shop.*
>
> *The owner handed me a burned croissant with tears in her eyes and apologized six times. Then made me the best cappuccino I've had in five years. This is what coffee shops should be: human.*
>
> *Every detail was attended to—the temperature, the timing, the care in each pour. But it was the WAY Rena makes coffee that got me. Like it matters. Like each cup is a gift she's giving you.*
>
> *She told me she named it The Hot Mess because 'the best things come from the mess—not despite it, but because of it. The mess is where we're honest.'*
>
> *I felt that. We're all hot messes, trying to make something beautiful.*
>
> *The coffee is perfect. Everything else is negotiable. And honestly? That's exactly what I needed.*
>
> *Rating: ☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️ (5/5)*
>
> *The Hot Mess, Downtown. Open Tuesday-Saturday 7-6. Tell Rena Ruby sent you. Bring your whole messy self."*

I'm crying again. Of course I'm crying. But this time it's different.

This time it's joy.

I sit down in the oversized chair Mother sent—the one she knew I'd curl up in with a book—and I let myself feel it. All of it. The terror and the failure and the kindness. The croissant on the floor and the cappuccino that was perfect despite everything.

"There is therefore NOW no condemnation," I whisper to my empty apartment.

And for the first time in a long time, I actually believe it.

[^1]: I checked approximately forty-seven times. Jennifer told me to stop checking. I did not stop checking.

[^2]: WHO WEARS WHITE JEANS TO A COFFEE SHOP? People with confidence, that's who. People who don't expect to spill things on themselves. People who are not me.

[^3]: The grounds on my shoe are from this morning. Or possibly yesterday. Time is meaningless when you're anxious.
